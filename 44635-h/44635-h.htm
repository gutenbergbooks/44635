<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>In the present volume I have attempted within the
limits of the historical period and of our European
civilisation, and without recognising any hard and
fast line between ancient and modern, Christian and
Pagan, to allude, in the places that seemed most
appropriate, to all points in the history of war that
appeared to be either of special interest or of essential
importance. As examples of such points I may refer
to the treatment of prisoners of war, or of surrendered
garrisons; the rules about spies and surprises; the introduction
of, and feeling about, new weapons; the
meaning of parts of military dress; the origin of
peculiar customs like the old one of kissing the earth
before a charge; the prevalent rules of honour, as displayed
in notions of justice in regard to reprisals, or of
fairness in stratagems and deception. The necessity
of observing in so vast a field the laws of proportion
has enforced resort to such condensation, that on
subjects which deserve or possess their tomes upon
tomes, I have in many cases been unable to spend
more than a page or a chapter. It is easier, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>ever,
to err on the side of length than of brevity, but
on whichever side I have exceeded, I can only hope
that others, who may feel the same interest with
myself in the subject without having the same time to
give to it, may derive a tithe of the pleasure from
reading the following nine chapters that I have found
in putting them together.</p>

<p>The study, of course, is no new one, but there can
be no objection to calling it by the new name of
Bellology&mdash;a convenient term, quite capable of holding
its own with Sociology or its congeners. The
only novelty I have aimed at is one of treatment, and
consists in never losing sight of the fact that to all
military customs there is a moral and human side
which has been only too generally ignored in this
connection. To read books like Grose’s ‘Military
Antiquities,’ one would think their writers were
dealing with the manners, not of men but of ninepins,
so utterly do they divest themselves of all human
interest or moral feeling, in reference to the customs
they describe with so laudable but toneless an
accuracy.</p>

<p>The starting-point of modern bellological studies
will, undoubtedly, always be the Parliamentary Blue
Book, containing the reports (less full than one might
wish) of the Military International Conference that
met at Brussels in 1874, to discuss the existing laws
and customs of war, and to consider whether any
modification of them were either possible or desirable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Most of the representatives appointed to attend by
the several Powers were military men, so that we are
carried by their conversation into the actual realities
of modern warfare, with an authority and sense of
truth that one is conscious of in no other military
book. It is to be regretted that such a work, instructive
as it is beyond any other on the subject, has
never been printed in a form more popular than its
official dress. It was from it that I first conceived
the idea of the following pages, and in the sequel
frequent reference will be made to it, as the source of
the most trustworthy military information we possess,
and as certain to be for some time to come
the standard work on all the actual laws and customs
of contemporary warfare.</p>

<p>It is impossible to head a chapter ‘The Laws of War’
without thinking of that famous chapter on Iceland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
headed ‘The Snakes of Iceland,’ wherein the writer
simply informed his readers that there were none in
the country. ‘The laws of war’ make one think of
the snakes of Iceland.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a summary denial of their existence
would deprive the history of the battle-field of one
of its most interesting features; for there is surely
nothing more surprising to an impartial observer of
military manners and customs than to find that even
in so just a cause as the defence of your own country
limitations should be set to the right of injuring your
aggressor in any manner you can.</p>

<p>What, for instance, can be more obvious in such a
case than that no suffering you can inflict is needless
which is most likely permanently to disable your
adversary? Yet, by virtue of the International
Declaration of St. Petersburg, in 1868, you may not
use explosive bullets against him, because it is held
that they would cause him needless suffering. By the
logic of war, what can be clearer than that, if the
explosive bullet deals worse wounds, and therefore
inflicts death more readily than other destructive
agencies, it should be used? or else that those too
should be excluded from the rules of the game&mdash;which
might end in putting a stop to the game altogether?</p>

<p>The history of the explosive bullet is worth recalling,
for its prohibition is a straw to clutch at in
these days of military revival. Like the plague, and
perhaps gunpowder, it had an Eastern origin. It was
used originally in India against elephants and tigers.
In 1863 it was introduced into the Russian army, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
subsequently into other European armies, for use
against ammunition-waggons. But it was not till
1867 that a slight modification in its construction
rendered it available for the destruction of mankind.
The world owes it to the humanity of the Russian
Minister of War, General Milutine, that at this point
a pause was made; and as the Czar, Alexander II.,
was no less humane than his minister, the result was
the famous Declaration, signed in 1868 by all the
chief Powers (save the United States), mutually foregoing
in their future wars by land or sea the use of
projectiles weighing less than 400 grammes (to save
their use for artillery), either explosive or filled with
inflammable substances. The Court of Berlin wished
at the time for some other destructive contrivances
to be equally excluded, but the English Government
was afraid to go further; as if requiring breathing
time after so immense an effort to diminish human
suffering, before proceeding in so perilous a direction.</p>

<p>The Declaration of St. Petersburg, inasmuch as it
is capable of indefinite expansion, is a somewhat
awkward precedent for those who in their hearts love
war and shield its continuance with apologetic platitudes.
How, they ask, can you enforce agreements
between nations? But this argument begins to totter
when we remember that there is absolutely no superior
power or tribunal in existence which can enforce the
observance of the St. Petersburg Declaration beyond
the conscience of the signatory Powers. It follows,
therefore, that if international agreements are of value,
there is no need to stop short at this or that bullet:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
which makes the arbitration-tribunal loom in the
distance perceptibly nearer than it did before.</p>

<p>At first sight, this agreement excluding the use
of explosive bullets would seem to favour the theory
of those who see in every increase in the peril of war
the best hope of its ultimate cessation. A famous
American statesman is reported to have said, and
actually to have appealed to the invention of gunpowder
in support of his statement, that every discovery
in the art of war has, from this point of view,
a life-saving and peace-promoting influence.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But it
is difficult to conceive a greater delusion. The whole
history of war is against it; for what has that history
been but the steady increase of the pains and perils of
war, as more effective weapons of destruction have
succeeded one another? The delusion cannot be
better dispelled than by consideration of the facts
that follow.</p>

<p>It has often seemed as if humanity were about to
get the better of the logical tendency of the military
art. The Lateran Council of 1139 (a sort of European
congress in its day) not only condemned Arnold of
Brescia to be burnt for heresy, but anathematised the
cross-bow for its inhumanity. It forbade its use in
Christian warfare as alike hateful to God and destructive
of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Several brave princes disdained
to employ cross-bow shooters, and Innocent III. con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>firmed
the prohibition on the ground that it was not
fair to inflict on an enemy more than the least possible
injury.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The long-bow consequently came into
greater use. But Richard I., in spite of Popes or
Councils or Chivalry, revived the use of the cross-bow
in Europe; nor, though his death by one himself
was regarded as a judgment from Heaven, did its use
from that time decline till the arquebus and then the
musket took its place.</p>

<p>Cannons and bombs were at first called diabolical,
because they suggested the malice of the enemy of
mankind, or serpentines, because they seemed worse
than the poison of serpents.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But even cannons were
at first only used against fortified walls, and there is a
tradition of the first occasion when they were directed
against men.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And torpedoes, now used without
scruple, were called infamous and infernal when, under
the name of American Turtles, they were first tried
by the American Colonies against the ships of their
mother country.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, that knight ‘without fear
or reproach,’ the Chevalier Bayard, ordered all musketeers
who fell into his hands to be slain without mercy,
because he held the introduction of fire-arms to be an
unfair innovation on the rules of lawful war. So red-hot
shot (or balls made red hot before insertion in
the cannon) were at first objected to, or only considered
fair for purposes of defence, not of attack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Yet, what do we find?&mdash;that Louis XIV. fired some
12,000 of them into Brussels in 1694; that the Austrians
fired them into Lille in 1792; and that the English
batteries fired them at the ships in Sebastopol
harbour, which formed part of the Russian defences.
Chain-shot and bar-shot were also disapproved of at
first, or excluded from use by conventions applying
only to particular wars; now there exists no agreement
precluding their use, for they soon became
common in battles at sea.</p>

<p>The invention of the bayonet supplies another
illustration. The accounts of its origin are little
better than legends: that it was invented so long ago
as 1323 by a woman of Bayonne in defence of the
ramparts of that city against the English; or by
Puséygur, of Bayonne, about 1650; or borrowed by
the Dutch from the natives of Madagascar; or connected
with a place called the Redoute de la Baïonnette
in the Eastern Pyrenees, where the Basques, having
exhausted their ammunition against the Spaniards,
are said to have inserted their knives into the muzzles
of their guns. But it is certain that as soon as the
idea was perfected by fixing the blade by rings outside
the muzzle (in the latter quarter of the seventeenth
century), battles became more murderous than ever,
though the destruction of infantry by cavalry was
diminished. The battle of Neerwinden in 1693,
in which the French general, Luxembourg, defeated
the Prince of Orange, is said to have been the first
battle that was decided by a charge with a bayonet,
and the losses were enormous on both sides.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>History, in fact, is full of such cases, in which the
victory has uniformly lain ultimately with the legitimacy
of the weapon or method that was at first
rejected as inhumane. For the moment, the law of
nations forbids the use of certain methods of destruction,
such as bullets filled with glass or nails, or
chemical compounds like kakodyl, which could convert
in a moment the atmosphere round an army into
one of deadly poison;<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> yet we have nothing like
certainty&mdash;we have not even historical probability&mdash;that
these forbidden means, or worse means, will not
be resorted to in the wars of the future, or that
reluctance to meet such forms of death will in the
least degree affect either their frequency or their
duration.</p>

<p>It is easy to explain this law of history. The
soldier’s courage, as he faces the mitrailleuse with the
same indifference with which he would face snow-balls
or bread-pellets, is a miracle of which discipline is the
simple explanation; for whether the soldier be hired
or coerced to face death, it is all one to him against
what kind of bullet he rushes, so long as discipline
remains&mdash;as Helvetius the French philosopher once
defined it, the art of making soldiers more afraid of
their own officers than of their enemy.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> To Clearchus,
the Lacedæmonian, is attributed the saying that a
soldier should always fear his own general more
than the enemy: a mental state easily produced
in every system of military mechanism. Whatever
form of death be in front of a man, it is less certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
than that in his rear. The Ashantees as they march
to battle sing a song which is the soldier’s philosophy
all the world over: ‘If I go on, I shall die;
if I stay behind I shall be killed; it is better to
go on.’<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>How often is it said, in extenuation of modern
warfare, that it is infinitely less destructive than that
of ancient or even mediæval times; and that the
actual loss of life in battle has not kept pace with
the development of new and more effective life-taking
implements! Yet it is difficult to imagine a stranger
paradox, or a proposition that, if true, would reflect
greater descredit on our mechanical science. If our
Gatling guns, or Nordenfeldt 5-barrels capable of
firing 600 rounds a minute, are less effective to
destroy an enemy than all the paraphernalia of a
mediæval army, why not in that case return to
weapons that by the hypothesis better fulfilled the
purposes of war? This question is a <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> of this soothing delusion; but as a matter
of fact, there is no comparison in destructiveness
between our modern warfare and that of our ancestors.
The apparent difference in our favour arises
from a practice alluded to by Philip de Commines,
which throws a flood of light upon the subject:
‘There were slain in this battle about 6,000 men,
which, to people that are unwilling to lie, may seem
very much; but in my time I have been in several
actions, where for one man that was really slain they
have reported a hundred, thinking by such an account
to please their masters; and they sometimes deceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
them with their lies.’ That is to say, as a rule
the number of the slain should be divided by a
hundred.</p>

<p>This remark applies even to battles like Crecy
or Agincourt, where the numbers slain were unusually
high, and where they are said to have been accurately
ascertained by counting after the victory. When
Froissart on such authority quotes 1,291 as the total
number of warriors of knightly or higher rank slain
at Crecy, it is possible of course that he is not the
victim of deception; but what of the 30,000 common
soldiers for whose death he also vouches? A monk of
St. Albans, also a contemporary, speaks only of an
unknown number (<i>et vulgus cujus numerus ignoratur</i>);
which in the account of the Abbot Hugo was put
definitely at more than 100,000. It is evident from
this that the greatest laxity prevailed in reference to
chronicling the numbers of the slain; so that if we
take 3,000 instead of 30,000 as the sum total of
common soldiers slain at Crecy, it is probable that
we shall be nearer the truth than if we implicitly
accept Froissart’s statement.</p>

<p>The same scepticism will of course hold good of
the battles of the ancient world. Is it likely, for
instance, that in a battle in which the Romans are
said only to have lost 100 men, the Macedonians
should have lost 20,000?<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Or again, is it possible,
considering the difficulty of the commissariat of a
large army, even in our own days of trains and telegraphs
and improved agriculture, that Marius in one
battle can have slain 200,000 Teutons, and taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
90,000 prisoners? But whilst no conclusion is possible
but that the figures of the older histories are
altogether too untrustworthy to afford any basis for
comparison, the calculation rests on something more
like fair evidence, that in the fortnight between
August 4, 1870, the date of the battle of Wissembourg,
and August 18, that of Gravelotte, including
the battles of Woerth and Forbach on August 6, of
Courcelles on the 14th, and of Vionville on the 16th
more than 100,000 French and Germans met their
death on the battle-field, to say nothing of those
who perished afterwards in agonies in the hospitals.
Recent wars have been undoubtedly shorter than
they often were in olden times, but their brevity is
founded on no reason that can ensure its recurrence:
nor, if 100,000 are to be miserably cast out of existence,
is the gain so very great, if the task, instead of
being spread over a number of years, requires only a
fortnight for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>For the nearest approach to a statement of what
the laws of war in our own time really are, we must
turn to the Brussels Conference, which met in 1874 at
the summons of the same great Russian to whom the
world owes the St. Petersburg Declaration, and which
constituted a genuine attempt to mitigate the evils of
war by an international agreement and definition of
their limits. The idea of such a plan was originally
suggested by the Instructions published in 1863 by
President Lincoln for the government of the armies of
the United States in the civil war.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The project for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
such an international agreement, originally submitted
by the Russian Government for discussion, was very
much modified before even a compromise of opinion
could be arrived at on the several points it contained.
And the project so modified, as a preliminary basis for
future agreement, owing to the timid refusal of the
English Government to take further part in the matter,
never, unfortunately, reached its final stage of a definite
code;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> but it remains nevertheless the most
authoritative utterance extant of the laws generally
thought to be binding in modern warfare on the
practices and passions of the combatants. The following
articles from the project as finally modified
are undoubtedly the most important:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Art. 12.</i> The laws of war do not allow to belligerents
an unlimited power as to the choice of means
of injuring the enemy.</p>

<p><i>Art. 13.</i> According to this principle are strictly
forbidden&mdash;</p>

<ul class="like_p">

<li><i>a.</i> The use of poison or poisoned weapons.</li>

<li><i>b.</i> Murder by treachery of individuals belonging
to the hostile nation or army.</li>

<li><i>c.</i> Murder of an antagonist who, having laid
down his arms, or having no longer the
means of defending himself, has surrendered
at discretion.</li>

<li><i>d.</i> The declaration that no quarter will be given.</li>

<li><i>e.</i> The use of arms, projectiles, or substances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
which may cause unnecessary suffering, as
well as of those prohibited by the Declaration
of St. Petersburg in 1868.</li>

<li><i>f.</i> Abuse of the flag of truce, the national flag,
or the military insignia or uniform of the
enemy, as well as the distinctive badges of
the Geneva Convention.</li>

<li><i>g.</i> All destruction or seizure of the enemy’s
property which is not imperatively required
by the necessity of war.</li></ul>

<p><i>Art. 15.</i> Fortified places are alone liable to be
besieged. Towns, agglomerations of houses or villages
which are open or undefended, cannot be attacked or
bombarded.</p>

<p><i>Art. 17.</i> ... All necessary steps should be taken
to spare as far as possible buildings devoted to religion,
arts, sciences, and charity, hospitals and places where
sick and wounded are collected, on condition that they
are not used at the same time for military purposes.</p>

<p><i>Art. 18.</i> A town taken by storm shall not be given
up to the victorious troops for plunder.</p>

<p><i>Art. 23.</i> Prisoners of war ... should be treated
with humanity.... All their personal effects except
their arms are to be considered their own property.</p>

<p><i>Arts. 36, 37.</i> The population of an occupied territory
cannot be compelled to take part in military
operations against their own country, nor to swear
allegiance to the enemy’s power.</p>

<p><i>Art. 38.</i> The honour and rights of the family, the
life and property of individuals, as well as their religious
convictions and the exercise of their religion,
should be respected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Private property cannot be confiscated.</p>

<p><i>Art. 39.</i> Pillage is expressly forbidden.</p>

<p>There is at first sight a pleasing ring of humanity
in all this, though, as yet, it only represents the better
military spirit, which is always far in advance of actual
military practice. In the monotonous history of war
there are always commanders who wage it with less
ferocity than others, and writers who plead for the
mitigation of its cruelties. As in modern history
a Marlborough, a Wellington, or a Villars forms a
pleasant contrast to a Feuquières, a Belleisle, or a Blücher,
so in ancient history a Marcellus or a Lucullus
helps us to forget a Marius or an Alexander; and the
sentiments of a Cicero or Tacitus were as far in advance
of their time as those of a Grotius or Vattel were of
theirs. According to the accident of the existence of
such men, the laws of war fluctuate from age to age;
but, the question arises, Do they become perceptibly
milder? do they ever permanently improve?</p>

<p>It will be said that they do, because it will be said
that they have; and that the annals of modern wars
present nothing to resemble the atrocities that may be
collected from ancient or mediæval history. Yet such
statements carry no conviction. Deterioration seems
as likely as improvement; and unless the custom is
checked altogether, the wars of the twentieth century
may be expected to exceed in barbarity anything of
which we have any conception. A very brief inquiry
will suffice to dispel the common assurances of improvement
and progress.</p>

<p>Poison is forbidden in war, says the Berlin Conference;
but so it always was, even in the Institutes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Menu, and with perhaps less difference of opinion in
ancient than in modern times. Grotius and Vattel and
most of their followers disallow it, but two publicists
of grave authority defend it, Bynkershoeck and Wolff.
The latter published his ‘Jus Gentium’ as late as 1749,
and his argument is worth translating, since it can only
be met by arguments which equally apply to other
modes of military slaughter. ‘Naturally it is lawful to
kill an enemy by poison; for as long as he is our enemy,
he resists the reparation of our right, so that we may
exercise against his person whatever suffices to avert
his power from ourselves or our possessions. Therefore
it is not unfair to get rid of him. But, since it comes
to the same thing whether you get rid of him by the
sword or by poison (which is self-evident, because in
either case you get rid of him, and he can no longer
resist or injure you), it is naturally lawful to kill an
enemy by poison.’ And so, he argues with equal force,
of poisoned weapons.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> That poison is not in use in
our day we do not therefore owe to our international
lawyers, but to the accident of tradition. In Roman
history the theory appears to have been unanimous
against it. ‘Such conduct,’ says the Roman writer
Florus of a general who poisoned some springs in order
to bring some cities in Asia to a speedier surrender,
‘although it hastened his victory, rendered it infamous,
since it was done not only against divine law, but
against ancestral customs.’<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Our statesman Fox refused
indignantly to avail himself of an offer to poison
Napoleon, but so did the Roman consuls refuse a
similar proposal with regard to Pyrrhus; and Tiberius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and the Roman senate replied to a plan for poisoning
Arminius, that the Roman people punished their
enemies not by fraud or in secret, but openly and in
arms.</p>

<p>The history of bombarding towns affords an instance
of something like actual deterioration in the
usages of modern warfare. Regular and simple bombardment,
that is, of a town indiscriminately and not
merely its fortresses, has now become the established
practice. Yet, what did Vattel say in the middle of
the last century? ‘At present we generally content
ourselves with battering the ramparts and defences of
a place. To destroy a town with bombs and red-hot
balls is an extremity to which we do not proceed
without cogent reasons.’ What said Vauban still
earlier? ‘The fire must be directed simply at the
defences and batteries of a place ... and not
against the houses.’ Then what of the English bombardment
of Copenhagen in 1807, when the cathedral
and some 300 houses were destroyed; what of the
German bombardment of Strasburg in 1870, where
rifled mortars were used for the first time,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and the
famous library and picture gallery destroyed; and
what lastly of the German bombardment of Paris,
about which, strangely enough, even the military conscience
of the Germans was struck, so that in the
highest circles doubts about the propriety of such
a proceeding at one time prevailed from a moral no
less than from a military point of view?<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>With respect again to sacred or public buildings,
warfare tends to become increasingly destructive. It
was the rule in Greek warfare to spare sacred buildings,
and the Romans frequently spared sacred and other
buildings, as Marcellus, for instance, at Syracuse.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Yet
when the French ravaged the Palatinate in 1689 they
not only set fire to the cathedrals, but sacked the
tombs of the ancient Emperors at Spiers. Frederick
II. destroyed some of the finest buildings at Dresden
and Prague. In 1814 the English forces destroyed
the Capitol at Washington, the President’s house, and
other public buildings;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and in 1815 the Prussian
general, Blücher, was with difficulty restrained from
blowing up the Bridge of Jena at Paris and the Pillar
of Austerlitz. Military men have always the excuse
of reprisals or accident for these acts of Vandalism. Yet
Vattel had said (in language which but repeated the
language of Polybius and Cicero): ‘We ought to spare
those edifices which do honour to human society, and
do not contribute to the enemy’s strength, such as
temples, tombs, public buildings, and all works of
remarkable beauty.’</p>

<p>Of as little avail has been the same writer’s observation
that those who tear up vines and cut down
fruit trees are to be looked upon as savage. The Fijian
islanders were barbarians enough, but even they used
as a rule to spare their enemies’ fruit trees; so did the
ancient Indians; and the Koran forbids the wanton
destruction of fruit trees, palm trees, corn and cattle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Then what shall we think of the armies of Louis XIV.
in the Palatinate not only burning castles, country-houses,
and villages, but ruthlessly destroying crops,
vines, and fruit trees?<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> or of the Prussian warrior,
Blücher, destroying the ornamental trees at Paris in
1815?</p>

<p>It is said that the Germans refused to let the
women and children leave Strasburg before they began
to bombard it in 1870.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Yet Vattel himself tells us
how Titus, at the siege of Jerusalem, suffered the
women and children to depart, and how Henri IV.,
besieging Paris, had the humanity to let them pass
through his lines.</p>

<p>It was in a campaign of this century, 1815, that
General Roquet collected the French officers, and bade
them tell the grenadiers that the first man who should
bring him in a Prussian prisoner should be shot;
and it was in reprisals for this that a few days later the
Prussians killed the French wounded at Genappe.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Grotius, after quoting the fact that a decree of the
Amphictyons forbade the destruction of any Greek
city in war, asserts the existence of a stronger bond
between the nations of Christendom than between
the states of ancient Greece. And then we remember
how the Prussians bombarded the Danish town of
Sönderborg, and almost utterly destroyed it, though
it lay beyond the possibility of their possession; and
we think of Peronne in France reduced to ruins, with
the greater part of its fine cathedral, in 1870; and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the German shells directed against the French fire-engines
that endeavoured to save the Strasburg
Library from the flames that consumed it; and we
wonder that so great a jurist could have been capable
of so grievous a delusion.</p>

<p>To murder a garrison that had made an obstinate
defence, or in order to terrorise others from doing the
same, was a right of modern war disputed by Grotius,
but admitted by Vattel not to be totally exploded
a century later. Yet they both quote cases which
prove that to murder enemies who had made a gallant
defence was regarded in ancient times as a violation
of the laws of war.</p>

<p>To murder enemies who had surrendered was as
contrary to Greek or Roman as it ever was to Christian
warfare. The general Greek and Roman practice
was to allow quarter to an enemy who surrendered,
and to redeem or exchange their prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> There
was indeed, by the laws of war, a right to slay or
enslave them, and though both rights were sometimes
exercised with great barbarity, the extent to which
the former right was exercised has been very much
exaggerated. Otherwise, why should Diodorus Siculus,
in the century preceding our era, have spoken
of mercy to prisoners as the common law (τὰ κοινὰ
νόμιμα), and of the violation of such law as an act of
exceptional barbarity?<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It may be fairly doubted
whether the French prisoners in the English hulks
during the war with Napoleon suffered less than the
Athenian prisoners in the mines of Syracuse; and as
to quarter, what of the French volunteers or Franc-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>tireurs
who in 1870 fell into the hands of the Germans,
or of the French peasants, who, though levied and
armed by the local authorities under the proclamation
of Napoleon, were, if taken, put to death by the Allies
in 1814?</p>

<p>Some other illustrations tend further to show that
there is no real progress in war, and that many of the
fancied mitigations of it are merely accidental and
ephemeral features.</p>

<p>The French and English in olden time used to
spare one another’s fishing boats and their crews.
‘Fishermen,’ said Froissart, ‘though there may be war
between France and England, never injure one another;
they remain friends, and assist each other in case of
need, and buy and sell their fish whenever one has a
larger quantity than the other, for if they were to fight
we should have no fresh fish.’<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Yet in the Crimean
war, the English fleets in the Baltic seized or burnt
the fishing boats of the Finns, and destroyed the
cargoes of fish on which, having been salted in the
summer months, they were dependent for their subsistence
during the winter.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Polybius informs us that the Œtolians were regarded
as the common outlaws of Greece, because they
did not scruple to make war without declaring it. Invasions
of that sort were regarded as robberies, not as
lawful wars. Yet declarations of war may now be
dispensed with, the first precedent for doing so having
been set by Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus, in 1627, issued some humane
Articles of War, which forbade, among other things,
injuries to old men, women, and children. Yet within
a few years the Swedish soldiery, like other troops of
their time, made the gratuitous torture and mutilation
of combatants or non-combatants a common episode
of their military proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>When Henry V. of England invaded France,
early in the fifteenth century, he forbade in his
General Orders the wanton injury of property, insults
to women, or gratuitous bloodshed. Yet four centuries
later the character of war had so little changed
that we find the Duke of Wellington, when invading
the same country, lamenting in a General Order that,
‘according to all the information which the Commander
of the Forces had received, outrages of all
descriptions’ had been committed by his troops, ‘in
presence even of their officers, who took no pains
whatever to prevent them.’<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The French complain that their last war with
Germany was not war, but robbery; as if pillage and
war had ever been distinct in fact or were distinguishable
in thought. There appears to have been very little
limit to the robbery that was committed under the
name of contributions; yet Vattel tells us that, though
in his time the practice had died out, the belligerent
sovereigns, in the wars of Louis XIV., used to regulate
by treaty the extent of hostile territory in which each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
might levy contributions, together with the amount
which might be levied, and the manner in which the
levying parties were to conduct themselves.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Is it not proved then by the above facts, that the
laws of war rather fluctuate from age to age within
somewhat narrow limits than permanently improve,
and that they are apt to lose in one direction whatever
they gain in another? Humanity in warfare now,
as in antiquity, remains the exception, not the rule;
and may be found now, as at all times, in books or in
the finer imaginations of a few, far more often than
in the real life of the battle-field. The plea of
shortening the horrors of war is always the plea for
carrying them to an extreme; as by Louvois for
devastating the Palatinate, or by Suchet, the French
general, for driving the helpless women and children
into the citadel of Lerida, and for then shelling them
all night with the humane object of bringing the
governor to a speedier surrender.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Writers on the Law of Nations have in fact led us
into a Fool’s Paradise about war (which has done
more than anything else to keep the custom in existence),
by representing it as something quite mild and
almost refined in modern times. Vattel, the Swiss
jurist, set the example. He published his work on the
rights of nations two years after the Seven Years’ War
had begun, and he speaks of the European nations in
his time as waging their wars ‘with great moderation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and generosity,’ the very year before Marshal Belleisle
gave orders to make Westphalia a desert. Vattel too it
was who first appealed to the amenities that occasionally
interrupt hostilities in support of his theory of the
generosity of modern warfare.</p>

<p>But what after all does it come to, if rival generals
address each other in terms of civility or interchange
acceptable gifts? At Sebastopol, the English Sir
Edmond Lyons sent the Russian Admiral Machinoff
the present of a fat buck, the latter acknowledging the
compliment with the return of a hard Dutch cheese.
At Gibraltar, when the men of Elliot’s garrison were
suffering severely from scurvy, Crillon sent them a
cartload of carrots. These things have always occurred
even in the fiercest times of military barbarism. At
the siege of Orleans (1429) the Earl of Suffolk sent the
French commander Dunois a present of dessert, consisting
of figs, dates, and raisins; and Dunois in return
sent Suffolk some fur for his cloak; yet there was
little limit in those days to the ferocity shown in war
by the French and English to one another. A ransom
was extorted even for the bodies of the slain. The
occasional gleams of humanity in the history of war
count for nothing in the general picture of its savagery.</p>

<p>The jurists in this way have helped to give a
totally false colour to the real nature of war; and
scarcely a day passes in a modern campaign that does
not give the lie to the rules laid down in the ponderous
tomes of the international-law writers. It is said that
Gustavus Adolphus always had with him in camp
a copy of ‘Grotius,’ as Alexander is said to have slept
over Homer. The improbability of finding a copy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
‘Grotius’ in a modern camp may be taken as an
illustration of the neglect that has long since fallen on
the restraints with which our publicists have sought
to fetter our generals, and of the futility of all such
endeavours.</p>

<p>All honour to Grotius for having sought to make
warfare a few degrees less atrocious than he found it;
but let us not therefore deceive ourselves into an
extravagant belief in the efficacy of his labours. Kant,
who lived later, and had the same problem to face,
cherished no such delusion as to the possibility of
humanising warfare, but went straight to the point of
trying to stop it altogether; and Kant was in every
point the better reasoner. Either would doubtless
have regarded the other’s reasoning on the subject as
Utopian; but which with the better reason?</p>

<p>Grotius took the course of first stating what the
extreme rights of war were, as proved by precedent
and usage, and of then pleading for their mitigation on
the ground of religion and humanity. In either case
he appealed to precedent, and only set the better
against the worse; leaving thereby the rights of war
in utter confusion, and quite devoid of any principle
of measurement.</p>

<p>Let us take as an illustration of his method the
question of the slaughter of women and children.
This he began with admitting to be a strict right of
war. Profane history supplied him with several instances
of such massacres, and so more especially did
Biblical history. He refrained, he expressly tells us,
from adducing the slaying of the women and children
of Heshbon by the Hebrews, or the command given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
to them to deal in the same way with the people
of Canaan, for these were the works of God, whose
rights over mankind were far greater than those of man
over beasts. He preferred, as coming nearer to the
practice of his own time, the testimony of that verse
in the Psalms which says, ‘Blessed shall he be who
shall dash thy children against a stone.’ Subsequently
he withdrew this right of war, by reference to the
better precedents of ancient times. It does not appear
to have occurred to him that the precedents of
history, if we go to them for our rules of war, will
prove anything, according to the character of the
actions we select. Camillus (in Livy) speaks of
childhood as inviolable even in stormed cities; the
Emperor Severus, on the other hand, ordered his
soldiers to put all persons in Britain to the sword
indiscriminately, and in his turn appealed to precedent,
the order, namely, of Agamemnon, that of the Trojans
not even children in their mothers’ womb should be
spared from destruction. The children of Israel were
forbidden in their wars to cut down fruit trees; yet
when they warred against the Moabites, ‘they stopped
all the wells of water and felled all the good trees.’
It was only possible in this way to distinguish the
better custom from the worse, not the right from the
wrong; either being equally justifiable on a mere
appeal to historical instances.</p>

<p>The rules of war which prevailed in the time
of Grotius&mdash;the early time of the Thirty Years’ War&mdash;may
be briefly summarised from his work as follows.
The rights of war extended to <i>all</i> persons within
the hostile boundaries, the declaration of war being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
essentially directed against every individual of a
belligerent nation. Any person of a hostile nation,
therefore, might be slain wherever found, provided it
were not on neutral territory. Women and children
might be lawfully slain (as it will be shown that they
were also liable to be in the best days of chivalry);
and so might prisoners of war, suppliants for their
lives, or those who surrendered unconditionally. It
was lawful to assassinate an enemy, provided it involved
no violation of a tacit or express agreement;
but it was unlawful to use poison in any form, though
fountains, if not poisoned, might be made undrinkable.
Anything belonging to an enemy might be destroyed:
his crops, his houses, his flocks, his trees, even his
sacred edifices, or his places of burial.</p>

<p>That these extreme rights of war were literally
enforced in the seventeenth century admits of no
doubt; nor if any of them have at all been mitigated,
can we attribute it so much to the humane attempt
of Grotius and his followers to set restrictions on the
rightful exercise of predominant force, as to the accidental
influence of individual commanders. It has
been well remarked that the right of non-combatants
to be unmolested in war was recognised by generals
before it was ever proclaimed by the publicists.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And
the same truth applies to many other changes in warfare,
which have been oftener the result of a temporary
military fashion, or of new ideas of military expediency,
than of obedience to Grotius or Vattel. They
set themselves to as futile a task as the proverbial
impossibility of whitening the negro; with this result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>&mdash;that
the destructiveness of war, its crimes, and
its cruelties, are something new even to a world that
cannot lose the recollection of the sack of Magdeburg
in 1631, or the devastation of the Palatinate in 1689.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The publicists have but recognised and reflected
the floating sentiments of their time, without giving
us any definite principle by which to separate the
permissible from the non-permissible practice in war.
We have seen how much they are at issue on the use
of poison. They are equally at issue as to the right
of employing assassination; as to the extent of the
legitimate use of fraud; as to the right of beginning a
war without declaration; as to the limits of the invader’s
rights of robbery; as to the right of the
invaded to rise against his invader; or as to whether
individuals so rising are to be treated as prisoners of
war or hanged as assassins. Let us consider what
they have done for us with regard to the right of
using savages for allies, or with regard to the rights
of the conqueror over the town he has taken by
assault.</p>

<p>The right to use barbarian troops on the Christian
battle-field is unanimously denied by all the modern
text-writers. Lord Chatham’s indignation against
England’s employment of them against her revolted
colonies in America availed as little. Towards the
end of the Crimean war Russia prepared to arm some
savage races within her empire, and brought Circassians
into Hungary in 1848.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> France employed African<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Turcos both against Austria in 1859 and against
Prussia in 1870; and it is within the recollection of
the youngest what came of the employment by Turkey
of Bashi-Bazouks. Are they likely not to be used in
future because Bluntschli, Heffter, or Wheaton prohibits
them?</p>

<p>To take a town by assault is the worst danger a
soldier can have to face. The theory therefore had a
show of reason, that without the reward of unlimited
licence he could never be brought to the breach. Tilly
is said to have replied, when he was entreated by
some of his officers to check the rapine and bloodshed
that has immortalised the sack of Magdeburg in 1631:
‘Three hours’ plundering is the shortest rule of war.
The soldier must have something for his toil and
trouble.’<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> It is on such occasions, therefore, that
war shows itself in its true character, and that M.
Girardin’s remark, ‘<i>La guerre c’est l’assassinat, la guerre
c’est le vol,</i>’ reads like a revelation. The scene never
varies from age to age; and the storming of Badajoz
and San Sebastian by the English forces in the
Peninsular War, or of Constantine in Algeria by the
French in 1837, teaches us what we may expect to
see in Europe when next a town is taken by assault,
as Strasburg might have been in 1870. ‘No age, no
nation,’ says Sir W. Napier, ‘ever sent forth braver
troops to battle than those who stormed Badajoz’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
(April 1812). Yet for two days and nights there
reigned in its streets, says the same writer, ‘shameless
rapacity, brutal intemperance, savage lust, cruelty,
and murder.’<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And what says he of San Sebastian
not a year and a half later? A thunderstorm that
broke out ‘seemed to be a signal from hell for the
perpetration of villany which would have shamed the
most ferocious barbarians of antiquity.’ ... ‘The
direst, the most revolting cruelty was added to the
catalogue of crime: one atrocity ... staggers the
mind by its enormous, incredible, indescribable barbarity.’<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
If officers lost their lives in trying to prevent
such deeds&mdash;whose very atrocity, as some one has
said, preserves them from our full execration, because
it makes it impossible to describe them&mdash;is it likely
that the gallant soldiers who crowned their bravery
with such devilry would have been one whit restrained
by the consideration that in refusing quarter, or in
murdering, torturing, or mutilating non-combatants,
they were acting contrary to the rules of modern
warfare?</p>

<p>If, then, we temper theory with practice, and desert
our books for the facts of the battle-field (so far as
they are ever told in full), we may perhaps lay down
the following as the most important laws of modern
warfare:</p>

<p>1. You may not use explosive bullets; but you
may use conical-shaped ones, which inflict far more
mutilation than round ones, and even explosive bullets
if they do not fall below a certain magnitude.</p>

<p>2. You may not poison your enemy, because you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
thus take from him the chance of self-defence: but
you may blow him up with a fougass or dynamite,
from which he is equally incapable of defending himself.</p>

<p>3. You may not poison your enemy’s drinking-water;
but you may infect it with dead bodies or
otherwise, because that is only equivalent to turning
the stream.</p>

<p>4. You may not kill helpless old men, women, or
children with the sword or bayonet; but as much as
you please with your Congreve rockets, howitzers, or
mortars.</p>

<p>5. You may not make war on the peaceable occupants
of a country; but you may burn their houses if
they resist your claims to rob them of their uttermost
farthing.</p>

<p>6. You may not refuse quarter to an enemy;
but you may if he be not equipped in a particular
outfit.</p>

<p>7. You may not kill your prisoners of war; but
you may order your soldiers not to take any.</p>

<p>8. You may not ask a ransom for your prisoners;
but you may more than cover their cost in the lump
sum you exact for the expenses of the war.</p>

<p>9. You may not purposely destroy churches,
hospitals, museums, or libraries; but ‘military exigencies’
will cover your doing so, as they will almost
anything else you choose to do in breach of any
other restrictions on your conduct.</p>

<p>And it is into these absurdities that the reasonings
of Grotius and his followers have led us. The
real dreamers, it appears, have been, not those who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
like Henri IV., Sully, St. Pierre, or Kant, have
dreamed of a world without wars, but those who have
dreamed of wars waged without lawlessness, passion,
or crime. On them be thrown back the taunts of
Utopianism which they have showered so long on
the only view of the matter which is really logical and
consistent. On them, at least, rests the shadow, and
must rest the reproach, of an egregious failure, unless
recent wars are of no account and teach no lesson.
And if their failure be real and signal, what remains
for those who wish for better things, and for some
check on deeds that threaten our civilisation, but to
turn their backs on the instructors they once trusted;
to light their fires rather than to load their shelves
with Grotius, Vattel, and the rest; and to throw in
their lot for the future with the opinion, hitherto
despised, though it was Kant’s, and the endeavour
hitherto discredited, though it was Henry the Great’s,
Sully’s, and Elizabeth’s&mdash;the opinion, that is, that it
were easier to abolish war than to humanise it, and
that only in the growth of a spirit of international
confidence lies any possible hope of its ultimate
extinction?</p>

<p>For an impartial estimate of the custom of war, the
best preparation is a study of its leading features
in the days of chivalry. Not only are most of our
modern military usages directly descended from that
period, though many claim a far remoter ancestry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
go back to the days of primitive savagery, but it is
the tradition of chivalry that chiefly keeps alive the
delusion that it is possible for warfare to be conducted
with humanity, generosity, and courtesy.</p>

<p>Hallam, for instance, observes that in the wars of
our Edward III., ‘the spirit of honourable as well as
courteous behaviour towards the foe seems to have
arrived at its highest point;’ and he refers especially
to the custom of ransoming a prisoner on his parole,
and to the generous treatment by the Black Prince of
the French king taken captive at Poitiers.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate the extreme exaggeration
of this view, and to show that with war, as with the
greater crimes, moral greatness is only connected accidentally,
occasionally, or in romance, it is necessary
to examine somewhat closely the warfare of the fourteenth
century. Chivalry, according to certain historians,
was during that century in process of decline;
but the decline, if any, was rather in the nature of its
forms and ceremonies than of its spirit or essence.
It was the century of the most illustrious names in
chivalry, in France of Bertrand du Guesclin, in
England of the Black Prince, Sir Walter Manny, Sir
John Chandos. It was the century of the battles of
Crecy, Poitiers, Avray, and Navarette. It was the
century of the Order of the Star in France, of the
Garter and the Bath in England. Above all, it was
the century of Froissart, who painted its manners and
thoughts with a vividness so surpassing that to read
his pages is almost to live in his time. So that the
fourteenth century may fairly be taken as the period
in which chivalry reached its highest perfection, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in which the military type of life and character attained
its noblest development. It is the century of which
we instinctively think when we would imagine a time
when the rivalry of brave deeds gave birth to heroism,
and the rivalry of military generosity invested even
the cruelties of the battle-field with the halo of
romance.</p>

<p>Imagination, however, plays us false here as elsewhere.
Froissart himself, who described wars and
battles and noble feats of arms with a candour equal
to his honest delight in them, is alone proof enough
that there seldom was a period when war was more
ferociously conducted; when the laws in restraint of
it, imposed by the voice of morality or religion, were
less felt; when the motives for it as well as the incentives
of personal courage, were more mercenary; or
when the demoralisation consequent upon it were
more widely or more fatally spread. The facts that
follow in support of this conclusion come, in default
of any other special reference, solely from that charming
chronicler; allusions to other sources being only
necessary to prove the existence of a common usage,
and to leave no room for the theory that the cases
gathered from Froissart were but occasional or accidental
occurrences.</p>

<p>Even savage tribes, like the Zulus, spare the lives
of women and children in war, and such a restraint is
the first test of any warfare claiming to rank above the
most barbarous. But in the fourteenth century such
indiscriminate slaughter was the commonest episode
of war: a fact not among the least surprising when
we remember that the protection of women and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
defenceless was one of the special clauses of the oath
taken by knights at the ceremony of investiture.
Five days after the death of Edward III., and actually
during negotiations between France and England, the
admirals of France and Spain, at the command of
the King of France, sailed for Rye, which they burnt,
slaying the inhabitants, whether men or women
(1377); and it is a reasonable supposition that the
same conduct marked their further progress of pillage
and incendiarism in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Nor were such acts only the incidents of maritime
warfare, and perpetrated merely by the pirates of
either country; for they occurred as frequently in
hostilities by land, and in connection with the noblest
names of Christendom. At Taillebourg, in Saintonge,
the Earl of Derby had all the inhabitants put to the
sword, in reprisals for the death of one knight, who
during the assault on the town had met with his
death. So it fared during the same campaign with
three other places in Poitou, the chronicler giving us
more details with reference to the fate of Poitiers.
There were no knights in the town accustomed to
war and capable of organising a defence; and it was
only people of the poorer sort who offered a brave but
futile resistance to the army. When the town was
won, 700 people were massacred; ‘for the Earl’s
people put every one to the sword, men, women, and
little children.’ The Earl of Derby took no steps to
stop the slaughter, but after many churches and
houses had been destroyed, he forbade under pain of
death any further incendiarism, apparently for no
other reason than that he wished to stay there for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
ten or twelve days. A few years later, when the
French had recovered Poitiers, the English knights,
who had been there, marched away to Niort, which,
on the refusal of the inhabitants to admit them, they
forthwith attacked and speedily won, owing to the
absence, as at Poitiers, of any knights to direct the
defence. The male and female inhabitants alike were
put to the sword. All these instances occur in one
short chapter of Froissart.</p>

<p>Sometimes this promiscuous slaughter even raised
its perpetrators to higher esteem. An episode of this
sort occurred in the famous war between the citizens of
Ghent and the Earl of Flanders. The Lord d’Enghien,
with 4,000 cavaliers and a large force of foot, besieged
the town of Grammont, which was attached to Ghent.
About four o’clock one fine Sunday in June, the
besiegers gained the town, and the slaughter, says
Froissart, was very great of men, women, and children,
for to none was mercy shown. Upwards of 500 of
the inhabitants were killed; numbers of old people
and women were burnt in their beds; and the town
being then set on fire in more than two hundred places,
was speedily reduced to ashes. ‘Fair son,’ said the Earl
of Flanders, greeting his returning relative, ‘you are
a valiant man, and if it please God will be a gallant
knight, for you have made a handsome beginning.’
History, however, may rejoice that so promising a
career was checked in the bud; for the young nobleman’s
death in a skirmish within a few days made his
first feat of arms also his last.</p>

<p>A similar story is connected with the memory of
the fighting Bishop of Norwich, famous in those days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Having been authorised by Pope Urban VI. to make
war on Pope Clement VII., he went and besieged the
town of Gravelines with shot and wild-fire, ‘till in the
end our men entered the town with their Bishop, when
they at his commandment destroying both man,
woman, and child, left not one alive of all those who
remained in the town.’<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This was in 1383; and it
will be observed how then, just as in later days, the
excuse of superior orders served as an excuse for the
perpetration of any crime, provided only it were committed
in war.</p>

<p>It would be an error to suppose that these things
were the mere accident of war, due to the passion of
the moment, or to the feeble control of leaders over
their men. In a very curious old French poem, called
‘The Vow of the Heron,’ indisputable evidence exists
that the slaughter of women and children was not
only often premeditated before the opening of hostilities,
but that an oath binding a man to it was sometimes
given and accepted as a token of commendable
bravery. The poem in question deals with historical
events and persons; and if not to be taken as literal
history, undoubtedly keeps within the limits of probability,
as proved by other testimony of the manners
of those times. Robert, Count of Artois, exiled from
France, comes to England, and bringing a roasted
heron before Edward III. and his court, prays them to
make vows by it before eating of it (in accordance
with the custom which attached to such oaths peculiar
sanctity) concerning the deeds of war they would undertake
against the kingdom of France. Edward III., the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Earl of Salisbury, Sir Walter Manny, the Earl of Derby,
Lord Suffolk, having all sworn according to the Count’s
wishes, Sir Fauquemont, striving to outdo them in
the profession of military zeal, swore that if the king
would cross the sea to invade France, he would always
appear in the van of his troops, carrying devastation
and fire and slaughter, and sparing not altars, nor
relations, nor friends, neither helpless women nor
children.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Let the reader reflect that these things occurred in
war, not of Christians against infidels, but of Christians
with one another, and in a period commonly belauded
for its advance in chivalrous humanity. The incidents
related were of too common occurrence to call for
special remark by their chronicler; but the peculiar
atrocities of the famous sack of Limoges, by the
express orders of Edward the Black Prince, were too
much even for Froissart. It is best to let him tell his
own story from the moment of the entry of the
besieging force: ‘The Prince, the Duke of Lancaster,
the Earls of Cambridge and of Pembroke, Sir
Guiscard d’Angle, and the others, with their men,
rushed into the town. You would then have seen
pillagers active to do mischief, running through the
town, slaying men, women, and children, according to
their commands. It was a most melancholy business,
for all ranks, ages, and sexes cast themselves on their
knees before the Prince, begging for mercy; but he
was so inflamed with passion and revenge that he
listened to none, but all were put to the sword, wherever
they could be found, even those who were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
guilty; for, I know not why, the poor were not spared,
who could not have had any part in this treason; but
they suffered for it, and indeed more than those who
had been the leaders of the treachery. There was not
that day in the city of Limoges any heart so hardened
or that had any sense of religion, who did not
deeply bewail the unfortunate events passing before
their eyes; for upwards of 3,000 men, women, and
children were put to death that day. God have
mercy on their souls, for they were veritable martyrs.’
Yet the man whose memory is stained with this crime,
among the blackest in history, was he whom not his
own country alone, but the Europe of his day, dubbed
the Mirror of Knighthood; and those who blindly
but (according to the still prevalent sophistry of
militarism) rightly carried out his orders counted
among them at least three of the noblest names in
England.</p>

<p>The absence in chivalry of any feeling strong
enough to save the lives of women from the sword
of the warrior renders improbable <i>à priori</i> any keen
scruples against making them prisoners of war. In
France such scruples were stronger than in England.
The soldiers of the Black Prince took captive the
Duchess of Bourbon, mother to the King of France,
and imprisoned her in the castle of Belleperche;
whence she was afterwards conducted into Guyenne,
and ransom exacted for her liberty. Similar facts
mark the whole period from the twelfth to the fifteenth
century. When the Crusaders under Richard I. took
Messina by assault, they carried off with their other
lawful spoils all the noblest women belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Sicilians.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Edward I. made prisoners of the queen of
Robert Bruce and her ladies, and of the Countess of
Buchan, who had crowned Bruce. The latter, he said, as
she had not used the sword, should not perish by it;
but for her lawless conspiracy she should be shut up in
a chamber of stone and iron, circular as the crown she
gave; and at Berwick she should be suspended in the
open air, a spectacle to travellers, and for her everlasting
infamy. Accordingly, a turret was fitted up
for her with a strong cage of lattice-work, made of
strong posts and bars of iron.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In the fifteenth century,
the English, in their war upon the French frontier,
according to Monstrelet, ‘made many prisoners, and
even carried off women, as well noble as not, whom
they kept in close confinement until they ransomed
themselves.’<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The notion, therefore, that in those
times any special courtesy was shown in war to the
weaker sex must be received with extreme latitude.
In 1194, Henry, Emperor of the Romans, having taken
Salerno in Apulia by storm, actually put up for
auction to his troops the wives and children of the
chief citizens whom he had slain and exiled.</p>

<p>To pass to the treatment of prisoners of war,
who, be it remembered, were only those who could
promise ransom. The old historian Hoveden, speaking
of a battle that was fought in 1173, says that
there fell in it more than 10,000 Flemings; the remainder,
who were taken captive, being thrown into
prison in irons, and there starved to death. There is
no evidence whether, or for how long, starving re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>mained
in vogue; but the iron chains were habitual,
down even to the fourteenth century or later, among
the Germans and Spaniards, the extortion of a heavier
ransom being the motive for increasing the weight of
chain and the general discomfort of prison. To let
a prisoner go at large on parole for his ransom was
an advance initiated by the French, that sprang
naturally out of a state of hostilities in which most of
the combatants became personally acquainted, but it
was still conduct so exceptional that Froissart always
speaks of it in terms of high eulogy. It was also an
advance that often sprang out of the plainest necessities
of the case, as when, after the battle of Poitiers,
the English found their prisoners to be double their
own numbers, wherefore in consideration of the risk
they ran, they either received ransom from them on
the spot or gave them their liberty in exchange for a
promise to bring their ransom-money at Christmas
to Bordeaux. Bertrand du Guesclin did the same by
the English knights after their defeat at Pontvalin;
and it was in reference to this last occasion that
Froissart calls attention to the superiority of the French
over the Germans in not shackling their prisoners
with a view to a heavier ransom. ‘Curses on them
for it,’ he exclaims of the Germans; ‘they are a people
without pity or honour, and they ought never to receive
quarter. The French entertained their prisoners
well and ransomed them courteously, without being
too hard upon them.’</p>

<p>Nevertheless we must suspect that this sort of
courtesy was rather occasional than habitual. Of this
same Du Guesclin, whom St.-Palaye calls the flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of chivalry,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> two stories are told that throw a different
but curious light on the manners of those times.
Having on one occasion defeated the English and
taken many of them prisoners, Du Guesclin tried to
observe the rules of distributive justice in the partition
of the captives, but failing of success and unable to
discover to whom the prisoners really belonged, he
and Clisson (who were brothers in arms) in order to
terminate the differences which the victorious French
had with one another on the subject, conceived that
the only fair solution was to have them all massacred,
and accordingly more than 500 Englishmen were put
to death in cold blood outside the gates of Bressière.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
So, on a second occasion, such a quantity of English
were taken that ‘there was not, down to the commonest
soldier, anyone who had not some prisoner of
whom he counted to win a good ransom; but as there
was a dispute between the French to know to whom
each prisoner belonged, Du Guesclin, to put them
all on a level, ordered them to put all to the sword,
and only the English chiefs were spared.’<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This
ferocious warrior, the product and pride of his time,
and the favourite hero of French chivalry, was hideous in
face and figure; and if we think of him, with his round
brown face, his flat nose, his green eyes, his crisp hair,
his short neck, his broad shoulders, his long arms, short
body, and badly made legs, we have evidently one of the
worst specimens of that type which was for so long the
curse of humanity, the warrior of mediæval Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>In respect, therefore, of Hallam’s statement that
the courtesy of chivalry gradually introduced an indulgent
treatment of prisoners which was almost
unknown to antiquity, it is clear that it would be
unwise to press too closely the comparison on this head
between pre-Christian and post-Christian warfare.
At the siege of Toledo, the Besque de Vilaines, a
fellow-soldier of Du Guesclin in the Spanish war, in
order to intimidate the besieged into a surrender,
had as many gallows erected in front of the city as
he had taken prisoners, and actually had more than
two dozen hung by the executioner with that object.
In the pages of Livy or Thucydides there may be
many a bad deed recorded, but at least there is nothing
worse than the deeds of the Besque de Vilaines, or
of Du Guesclin, Constable of France, or of Edward
the Black Prince of England.</p>

<p>There is another point besides the fettering of
prisoners in which attention is drawn in Froissart to
the exceptional barbarity of the Spaniards; and in no
estimate of the military type of life in the palmiest
days of chivalry would it be reasonable to omit all
consideration of Spain. In the war between Castile
and Portugal, the forces under Don John of Castile
laid siege to Lisbon, closely investing it; and if any
Portuguese were taken prisoners in a skirmish or otherwise,
their eyes were put out, their legs, arms, or other
members torn off, and in such plight they were sent
back to Lisbon with the message that when the town
was taken mercy would be shown to none. Such
was the story told by the Portuguese ambassador to
the Duke of Lancaster, and repeated on his authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
by Froissart. For the credit of humanity, to say
nothing of chivalry, one would fain disbelieve the tale
altogether, or regard it as an episode that stood by
itself and apart from the general practice of the
age, since it is the only one of the kind related by
Froissart. But the frequency as much as the rarity
of a practice may account for the silence of an annalist,
and there is little doubt that mutilation of the
kind described was common in the chivalrous period,
even if obsolete or nearly so in the fourteenth century.
Blinding and castration were not only punishments
inflicted for offences against the forest laws of the
Norman kings of England, but were the common fate
of captive enemies in arms throughout Europe in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries. This, for instance,
was the treatment of their Welsh prisoners by the
Earls of Shrewsbury and Chester in 1098; as also of
William III., King of Sicily, at the hands of Henry,
Emperor of the Romans, in 1194. At the close of
the twelfth century, in the war between Richard I. of
England and Philip Augustus of France, blinding was
resorted to on both sides; for Hoveden expressly
says: ‘The King of France had the eyes put out of
many of the English king’s subjects whom he had
made prisoners, and this provoked the King of England,
unwilling as he was, to similar acts of impiety.’ And
to take a last instance, in 1225, the Milanese having
taken prisoners 500 Genoese crossbowmen, deprived
each of them of an eye and an arm, in revenge for the
injury done by their bows.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> So that it would be interesting,
if possible, to learn from some historian the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
date and cause of the cessation of customs so profoundly
barbarous and brutal.</p>

<p>By the rules, again, of chivalrous warfare all
persons found within a town taken by assault were
liable, and all the male adults likely, to be killed.
Bertrand du Guesclin made it a maxim before attacking
a place to threaten its commander with the
alternative of surrender or death; a military custom
perhaps as old as war itself, and one that has descended
unchanged to our own times. Only by a
timely surrender could the besieged cherish any hope
for their lives or fortunes; and even the offer of a
surrender might be refused, and an unconditional surrender
be insisted upon instead. This is proved by
the well-known story of Edward III. at the siege of
Calais, a story sometimes called in doubt merely for
resting solely on the authority of Froissart. The
governor of Calais offered to surrender the town and
all things in it, in return for a simple permission to
leave it in safety. Sir Walter Manny replied that
the king was resolved that they should surrender
themselves solely to his will, to ransom or kill them
as he pleased. The Frenchman retorted that they
would suffer the direst extremities rather than submit
to the smallest boy in Calais faring worse than the
rest. The king obstinately refused to change his
mind, till Sir Walter Manny, pressing upon him the
reluctance of his officers to garrison his castles with
the prospect of reprisals which such an exercise of
his war-right would render probable, Edward so far
relented as to insist on having six citizens of Calais
left to the absolute disposal of his revenge. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the six who offered themselves as a sacrifice for the
rest of their fellow-citizens reached the presence of
the king, the latter, though all the knights around
him were moved even to tears, gave instant orders to
behead them. All who were present pleaded for them,
and above all, Sir Walter Manny, in accordance with
his promise to the French governor; but it was all
in vain, and but for the entreaties of the queen, those
six citizens would have fallen victims to the savage
wrath of the pitiless Edward.</p>

<p>Two facts support the probable truth of the above
narrative from Froissart. In the first place, it is in
perfect keeping with the conduct of the same warrior
at the taking of Caen. When the king heard what
mischief the inhabitants had inflicted on his army by
their vigorous defence, he gave orders that all the rest
of the inhabitants should be slain and the town burnt;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
and had it not been for the remonstrances of Sir
Godfrey de Harcourt, there is little reason to doubt but
that he would thus have glutted, as he craved to do, the
intense native savagery of his soul. In the second
place, the story is in perfect keeping with the common
war-rule of that and later times, by virtue of which a
conqueror might always avail himself of the distress of
his enemy to insist upon a surrender at discretion,
which of course was equivalent to a surrender to death
or anything else.</p>

<p>How commonly death was inflicted in such cases
may be shown from some narratives of capitulations
given by Monstrelet. When Meaux surrendered to
Henry V., six of the defenders were reserved by name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to be delivered up to justice (such was the common
expression), and four were shortly after beheaded at
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> When Meulan surrendered to the regent, the
Duke of Bedford, numbers were specially excepted
from those to whom the Duke granted their lives, ‘to
remain at the disposal of the lord regent.’<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> When
some French soldiers having taken refuge in a fort
were so closely besieged by the Earl Marshal of
England as to be obliged to surrender at discretion,
many of them were hanged.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> When the garrison of
Guise capitulated to Sir John de Luxembourg, a
general pardon was granted to all, except to certain
who were to be delivered up to justice.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> When the
same captain, with about one thousand men, besieged
the castle of Guetron, wherein were some sixty or
eighty Frenchmen, the latter proposed to surrender
on condition of the safety of their lives and fortunes;
‘they were told they must surrender at discretion. In
the end, however, it was agreed to by the governor that
from four to six of his men should be spared by Sir
John. When this agreement had been settled and
pledges given for its performance, the governor re-entered
the castle, and was careful not to tell his companions
the whole that had passed at the conference,
giving them to understand in general that they were to
march away in safety; but when the castle was surrendered
all within it were made prisoners. On the
morrow, by the orders of Sir John de Luxembourg, they
were all strangled and hung on trees hard by, except
the four or six before mentioned&mdash;one of their com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>panions
serving for the executioner.’<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> One more of
these black acts, so common among the warriors of
chivalry, and this point perhaps will be accepted as
proved. The French had gained possession of the castle
of Rouen, but after twelve days were obliged to surrender
at discretion to the English; ‘they were all made
prisoners, and put under a good guard; and shortly
after, one hundred and fifty were beheaded at Rouen.’<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Let us pass next from the animate to the inanimate
world as affected by warfare. The setting on
fire of Grammont in more than two hundred places is
a fair sample of the normal use of arson as a military
weapon in the chivalrous period. To burn an undefended
town or village was accounted no meanness;
and was as frequent as the destruction of crops, fruit
trees, or other sources of human subsistence. The
custom of tearing up vines or fruit trees contrasts
strongly with the command of Xerxes to his forces to
spare the groves of trees upon their march; and any
reader of ancient history will acknowledge the vast
deterioration from the pagan laws of war which every
page of the history of Christian chivalry reveals and
exposes.</p>

<p>But little as was the forbearance displayed in war
towards defenceless women and children, or to the
crops and houses that gave them food and shelter, it
might perhaps have been expected that, at a time
when no serious dissent had come to divide Christianity,
and when the defence of religion and religious
ceremonies were among the professed duties of knighthood,
churches and sacred buildings should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
enjoyed especial immunity from the ravages of war.
Even in pagan warfare the temples of the enemy as a
rule were spared; such an act as the destruction of
the sacred edifices of the Marsi by the Romans under
Germanicus being contrary to the better traditions of
Roman military precedent.</p>

<p>Permissible as it was by the rules of war, says
Polybius, to destroy an enemy’s garrisons, cities, or
crops, or anything else by which his power might be
weakened, it was the part of mere rage and madness
to destroy such things as their statues or temples,
by which no benefit or injury accrued to one side or
the other; nor are allusions to violations of this rule
numerous in pre-Christian warfare.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The practice of
the Romans and Macedonians to meet peaceably
together in time of war on the island of Delos, on
account of its sanctity as the reputed birthplace of
Apollo,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> has no parallel in the history of war among
the nations of Christendom. The most that can be
said for the fourteenth century in this respect is that
slightly stronger scruples protected churches and
monasteries than the lives of women and children.
This is implied in Froissart’s account of the storming
of Guerrande: ‘Men, women, and children were put
to the sword, and fine churches sacrilegiously burnt;
at which the Lord Lewis was so much enraged, that
he immediately ordered twenty-four of the most active
to be hanged on the spot.’</p>

<p>But the slightest embitterment of feeling removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
all scruples in favour of sacred buildings. Richard II.,
having with his army crossed the Tweed, took up his
quarters in the beautiful abbey of Melrose; after which
the monastery, though spared in all previous wars with
Scotland, was burnt, because the English had determined,
says Froissart, to ruin everything in Scotland
before returning home, in revenge for the recent alliance
entered into by that country with France. The
abbey of Dunfermline, where the Scotch kings used to
be buried, was also burnt in the same campaign; and
so it fared with all other parts of Scotland that the
English overran; for they ‘spared neither monasteries
nor churches, but put all to fire and flame.’</p>

<p>Neither did any greater degree of chivalry display
itself in the matter of the modes and weapons of
warfare. Although reason can urge no valid objection
against the means of destruction resorted to by hostile
forces, whether poisoned arrows, explosive bullets, or
dynamite, yet certain things have been generally
excluded from the category of fair military practices,
as for example the poisoning of an enemy’s water.
But the warriors of the fourteenth century, even if they
stand acquitted of poisoning rivers and wells, had no
scruples about poisoning the air: which perhaps is
nearly equivalent. The great engines they called
Sows or Muttons, like that one, 120 feet wide and 40
feet long, from which Philip von Artefeld and the men
of Ghent cast heavy stones, beams of wood, or bars of
hot copper into Oudenarde, must have made life inside
such a place unpleasant enough; but worse things
could be injected than copper bars or missiles of
wood. The Duke of Normandy, besieging the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
garrison at Thin-l’Evêque, had dead horses and other
carrion flung into the castle, to poison the garrison by
the smell; and since the air was hot as in midsummer,
it is small wonder that the dictates of reason soon
triumphed over the spirit of resistance. And at the
siege of Grave the chivalry of Brabant made a similar
use of carrion to empoison the garrison into a surrender.</p>

<p>Even in weapons different degrees of barbarity are
clearly discernible, according as they are intended to
effect a disabling wound, or a wound that will cause
needless laceration and pain by the difficulty of their
removal. A barbed arrow or spear betokens of course
the latter object, and it is worth visiting the multi-barbed
weapons in Kensington Museum from different
parts of the world, to learn to what lengths military
ingenuity may go in this direction. The spear heads
of the Crusaders were barbed;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and so were the arrows
used at Crecy and elsewhere, as may be seen on reference
to the manuscript pictures, the object being to
make it impossible to extract them without laceration
of the flesh. The sarbacane or long hollow tube was in
use for shooting poisoned arrows at the enemy;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and
pictures remain of the vials of combustibles that were
often attached to the end of arrows and lances.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The above facts clearly show the manner and spirit
with which our ancestors waged war in the days
of what Hallam calls chivalrous virtue: one of the
most stupendous historical impostures that has ever
become an accepted article of popular belief. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
military usages of the Greeks and Romans were mild
and polished, compared to the immeasurable savagery
which marked those of the Christians of Froissart’s
day. As for the redeeming features, the rare generosity
or courtesy to a foe, they might be cited in
almost equal abundance from the warfare of the Red
Indians; but what sheds a peculiar stain on that of
the Chevaliers is the ostentatious connection of religion
with the atrocities of those blood-seeking marauders.
The Church by a peculiar religious service blessed and
sanctified both the knight and his sword; and the
most solemn rite of the Christian faith was profaned to
the level of a preliminary of battle. At Easter and
Christmas, the great religious festivals of a professedly
peace-loving worship, the Psalm that was deemed most
appropriate to be sung in the chapels of the Pope and
the King of France was that beginning, ‘Benedictus
Dominus Deus meus, qui docet manus meas ad bellum
et digitos meos ad prœlia.’</p>

<p>It was a curious feature of this religion of war that,
when Edward III.’s forces invaded France, so strict
was the superstition that led them to observe the fast
of Lent, that among other things conveyed into the
country were vessels and boats of leather wherewith to
obtain supplies of fish from the lakes and ponds of
the enemy.</p>

<p>It is indeed passing strange that Christianity,
which could command so strict an observance of its
ordinances as is implied in the transport of boats to
catch fish for Lent, should have been powerless to
place any check whatever on the ferocious militarism
of the time; and the very little that was ever done by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the Church to check or humanise warfare is an eternal
reflection on the so-called conversion of Europe
to Christianity. Nevertheless the Church, to do her
justice, used what influence she possessed on the side
of peace in a manner she has long since lost sight of;
nor was the Papacy in its most distracted days ever
so indifferent to the evils of war as the Protestant
Church has been since, and is still. Clement VI.
succeeded in making peace between France and
England, just as Alexander III. averted a war between
the two countries in 1161. Innocent VI. tried
to do the same; and Urban V. returned from Rome
to Avignon, hoping to effect the same good object.
Gregory XI. was keenly distressed at the failure of
efforts similar to those of his predecessors. The Popes
indeed endeavoured to stop wars, as they endeavoured
to stop tournaments, or the use of the crossbow; but
they were defeated by the intense barbarism of
chivalry; nor can it be laid to the charge of the
Church of Rome, as it can to that of the Church of
the Reformation, that she ever folded her hands
in despairful apathy before a custom she admitted to
be evil. The cardinals and archbishops of those days
were constantly engaged in pacific, nor always futile,
embassies. And the prelates would frequently preach
to either side arguments of peace: a fact that contrasts
badly with the almost universal silence and impotence
of the modern pulpit, either to stay a war or to
mitigate its barbarities.</p>

<p>But it is true that they knew equally well how to
play on the martial as on the pacific chord in their
audiences; for the eloquence of an Archbishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Toulouse turned sixty towns and castles to the interest
and rights of the French king in his quarrel with
England; and the preaching of prelates and lawyers
in Picardy had a similar effect in other large towns.
Nor were the English clergy slower than the French
to assert the rights of their king and country, for
Simon Tibald, Bishop of London, made several long
and fine sermons to demonstrate (as always is
demonstrated in such cases) that the King of France
had acted most unjustly in renewing the war, and that
his conduct was at total variance both with equity
and reason.</p>

<p>But these appeals to the judgment of their
congregations by the clergy are also a proof that
in the fourteenth century the opinion of the people
did not count for so little as is often supposed in the
making of peace and war. Yet the power of the
people in this respect was doubtless as insignificant as
it still is in our own days: nothing being more remarkable,
even in the free government of modern England,
than the influence of the people in theory and their
influence in fact on the most important question that
regards their destinies.</p>

<p>Nor are the moral causes difficult to trace which
in those times made wars break out so frequently and
last so long, that those who now read of them can only
marvel how civilisation ever emerged at all, even to the
imperfect degree to which it is given to us to enjoy it.
The love of adventure and the hope of fame were of
course among the principal motives. The saying of
Adam Smith, that the great secret of education is the
direction of personal vanity to proper objects, contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the key to all advance that has ever been made in
civilisation, and to every shortcoming. The savagery
of the middle ages was due to the direction of personal
vanity exclusively into military channels, so that the
desire for distinction often displayed itself in forms of
perfect absurdity, as in the case of the young English
knights who went abroad with one eye veiled, binding
themselves by a vow to their ladies neither to see
with their eyes nor to reply to anything asked of them
till they had signalised themselves by the performance
of some wondrous deed in France. The gradual
opening up in later days of other paths to distinction
than that of arms has very much diminished the
danger to the public peace involved in the worthless
education of our ancestors.</p>

<p>Nor was the personal distinction of the warrior
gained at any great risk of personal danger. The
personal danger in war decreased in exact ratio with
the rank of the combatant, and it was only the lower
orders of the social hierarchy who unreservedly risked
their lives. In case of defeat they had no ransom to
offer for mercy, and appear almost habitually to have
been slain without any. If it was a common thing for
either side to settle before a battle the names of those
on the other who should be admitted to ransom, it was
no uncommon thing to determine, as the English did
before Crecy, to give no quarter to the enemy at all.
But as a rule the battle-field was of little more peril to
the knight than the tournament; and though many
perished when powerless to avert the long thin dagger,
called the <i>miséricorde</i>, from the interstices of their
armour or the vizor of their helmets, yet the striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
fact in Froissart is the great number of battles,
skirmishes, and sieges in which the same names occur,
proving how seldom their bearers were wounded,
disabled, or killed. This of course was due mainly
to the marvellous defensive armour they wore, which
justifies the wonder not merely how they fought but
even how they moved. Whether encased in coats of
mail, sewn upon or worn over the gambeson or thick
undergarment of cloth or leather, or in plates of solid
steel, at first worn over the mail and then instead
of it, and often with the plastron or breastplate of
forged iron beneath both hauberk and gambeson,
they evidently had little to fear from arrow, sword,
or lance, unless when they neglected to let down
the vizor of the helmet, as Sir John Chandos did,
when he met with his death from a lance wound
in the eye (1370). Their chief danger lay in the
hammering of battle-axes on their helmets, which
stunned or wounded, but seldom killed them. But
the foot soldiers and light cavalry, though generally
well equipped, were less well protected by armour than
the knights, the hauberk or coat of mail being allowed
in France only to persons possessed of a certain
estate; so that the knights were formidable less
to one another than to those who by the conditions of
the combat could not be so formidable to themselves.</p>

<p>The surcoat was also a defence to the knight, as
indicating the ransom he could pay for his life.
Otherwise it is impossible to account for his readiness
to go into action with this long robe flowing over his
plate of steel and all his other accoutrements. Had
Sir John Chandos not been entangled in his long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
surcoat when he slipped, he might have lived to fight
many another battle to the honour of English chivalry.
Richness of armour served also the same purpose as
the surcoat. At the battle of Nicopoli, when the
flower of the French nobility met with so disastrous a
defeat at the hands of the Turks, the lords of France
were, says Froissart, so richly dressed out in their
emblazoned surcoats as to look like little kings, and
many for a time owed their lives to the extreme richness
of their armour, which led the Saracens to suppose
them greater lords than they could really boast to be.
So again the elaborate gold necklaces worn by distinguished
officers in the seventeenth century were
probably rather symbols of the ransom their wearers
could pay, than worn merely for ostentation and vanity.
It was to carelessness on this score that the Scotch
owed their great losses at the battle of Musselborough
in 1548: for (to put the words of Patin in modern
dress) their ‘vileness of port was the cause that so
many of the great men and gentlemen were killed and
so few saved. The outward show, the semblance and
sign whereby a stranger might discern a villain from
a gentleman, was not among them to be seen.’</p>

<p>War under these conditions chiefly affected the
lives of the great by pleasantly relieving the monotony
of peaceful days. In time of peace they had few
occupations but hawking, hunting, and tilting, and
during hostilities those amusements continued. Field
sports, sometimes spoken of by their eulogists as the
image of war, were not absent during its reality.
Edward III. hunted and fished daily during his campaign
in France, having with him thirty falconers on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
horseback, sixty couples of staghounds, and as many
greyhounds. And many of his nobles followed his
example in taking their hawks and hounds across the
Channel.</p>

<p>But the preceding causes of the frequency of war
in the days of chivalry are quite insignificant when
compared with that motive which nowadays mainly
finds vent in the peaceful channels of commerce&mdash;namely,
the common desire of gain. The desire for
glory had far less to do with it than the desire of
lucre; nor is anything from the beginning to the
end of Froissart more conspicuously displayed than
the merely mercenary motive for war. The ransom
of prisoners or of towns, or even ransom for the
slain,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> afforded a short and royal road to wealth,
and was the chief incentive, as it was also the chief
reward of bravery. The Chevalier Bayard made by
ransoms in the course of his life a sum equal to
4,000<i>l.</i>, which in those days must have been a fortune;<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
and Sir Walter Manny in a single campaign enriched
himself by 8,000<i>l.</i> in the same way.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> So that the
story is perfectly credible of the old Scotch knight, who
in a year of universal peace prayed, ‘Lord, turn the
world upside down that gentlemen may make bread
of it.’ Loot and rapine, the modern attractions of the
brigand, were then in fact the main temptations of
the knight or soldier; and the distinction between
the latter and the brigand was far less than it had
been in the pre-Christian period, or than it is in more
modern times. Indeed the very word <i>brigand</i> meant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
originally, merely a foot-soldier who fought in a
brigade, in which sense it was used by Froissart;
and it was only the constant addiction of the former
to the occupations of the highwayman that lent to
the word brigand its subsequent evil connotation.</p>

<p>But it was not merely the common soldier to whom
the first question in a case of war was the profit
to be gained by it; for men of the best families of
the aristocracy were no less addicted to the land
piracy which then constituted war, as is proved by such
names as Calverly, Gournay, Albret, Hawkwood, and
Guesclin. The noble who was a soldier in war often
continued to fight as a robber after peace was made,
nor thought it beneath him to make wretched villagers
compound for their lives; and in spite of truces and
treaties, pillage and ransom afforded his chief and
often his sole source of livelihood. The story of
Charles de Beaumont dying of regret for the ransom
he had lost, because by mistake he had slain instead
of capturing the Duke of Burgundy at the battle of
Nancy, is a fair illustration of the dominion then
exercised by the lowest mercenary feelings over the
nobility of Europe.</p>

<p>This mercenary side of chivalrous warfare has been
so lost sight of in the conventional descriptions of
it, that it is worth while to bring into prominence
how very little the cause of war really concerned
those who took part in it, and how unfounded is
the idea that men troubled to fight for the weak or
the oppressed under fine impulses of chivalry, and
not simply in any place or for any object that held
out to them the prospect of gain. How otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
is it possible to account for the conduct of the Black
Prince, in fighting to restore Pedro the Cruel to the
throne of Castile, from which he had been displaced
in favour of Henry of Trastamare not merely by the
arms of Du Guesclin and the French freebooters, but
by the wishes and consent of the people? Any
thought for the people concerned, or of sympathy for
their liberation, as little entered into the mind of the
Black Prince as if the question had concerned toads
or rabbits. Provided it afforded an occasion for fighting,
it mattered nothing that Pedro had ruled oppressively;
that he had murdered, or at least was believed to
have murdered, his wife, the sister of the reigning King
of France: nor that he had even been condemned by
the Pope as an enemy to the Christian Church. Yet
before the battle of Navarette (1367), in which Henry
was completely defeated, the Prince did not hesitate
in his prayers for victory to assert that he was waging
war solely in the interests of justice and reason; and
it was for his success in this iniquitous exploit (a
success which only awaited his departure from the
country to be followed by a rising in favour of the
monarch he had deposed) that the Prince won his
chief title to fame; that London exhausted itself in
shows, triumphs, and festivals in his honour; and
that Germans, English, and Flemish with one accord
entitled him ‘the mirror of knighthood.’ The Prince
was only thirteen when he fought at Crecy, and he
fought with courage: he was only ten years older
when he won the battle of Poitiers, and he behaved
with courtesy to the captive French king, from whom
he looked for an extortionate ransom: but the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>travagant
eulogies commonly heaped upon him prove
how little exalted in reality was the military ideal of
his age. His sack of Limoges, famous among military
atrocities, has already been spoken of; nor should it
be forgotten, as another indication of his character,
that when two messengers brought him a summons
from the King of France to answer the appeal of the
Gascons of Aquitaine, he actually imprisoned them,
showing himself however in this superior to his nobles
and barons, who actually advised capital punishment
as the fittest salary to the envoys for their pains.</p>

<p>The Free Companies, or hordes of robbers, who
ravaged Europe through all the period of chivalry
and constituted the greatest social difficulty of the
time, were simply formed of knights and men-at-arms,
who, when a public war no longer justified them in
robbing and murdering on behalf of the State, turned
robbers and murderers on their own account. After
the treaty of Bretigny had put a stop to hostilities
between France and England (1360), 12,000 of these
men, men of rank and family as well as needy adventurers,
and under leaders of every nationality, resolved
sooner than lay down their arms to march into Burgundy,
there to relieve by the ransoms they might
levy the poverty they could not otherwise avert.
Many a war had no other justification than the
liberation of one people from their outrages by turning
them upon another. Thus Du Guesclin led his
White Company into Spain on behalf of Henry the
Bastard, less to avenge the cruelties of Pedro than to
free France from the curse of her unemployed chivalry;
and Henry the Bastard, when by such help he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
wrested the kingdom of Castile from his brother
Pedro, designed an invasion of Granada simply to
divert from his own territories the allies who had placed
him in possession of them. This was a constant
source of war in those days, just as in our own the
existence of large armies leads of necessity to wars
for their employment; and even the Crusades derive
some explanation from the operation of the motive
indicated.</p>

<p>No historical microscope, indeed, will detect any
difference between the Free Companies and the regular
troops, since not only the latter merged into the
former, but both were actuated by the sole pursuit of
gain, and equally indifferent to ideas of honour or
patriotism. The creed of both was summed up in the
following regretful speech, attributed to Aymerigot
Marcel, a great captain of the pillaging bands: ‘There
is no pleasure in the world like that which men such
as ourselves enjoyed. How happy were we when,
riding out in search of adventures, we met a rich
abbot, a merchant, or a string of mules, well laden
with draperies, furs, or spices, from Montpellier, Beziers,
and other places! All was our own, or ransomed
according to our will. Every day we gained money,
... we lived like kings, and when we went abroad
the country trembled; everything was ours both in
going and returning.’</p>

<p>In the days of chivalry, this desire of gain, however
gotten, pervaded and vitiated all classes of men
from the lowest to the highest. Charles IV. of France,
when his sister Isabella, queen of Edward II., fled
to him, promised to help her with gold and silver, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
secretly, lest it should bring him into war; and then
when messengers from England came with gold and
silver and jewels for himself and his ministers, both
he and his council became in a short time as cold to
the cause of Isabella as they had been warm, the king
even going so far as to forbid any of his subjects
under pain of banishment to help his sister in her
projected return. And again, when Edward III. was
about to make war with France, was he not told that
his allies were men who loved to gain wealth, and
whom it was necessary to pay beforehand? And did
he not find that a judicious distribution of florins was
as effective in winning over to his interests a duke, a
marquis, an archbishop, and the lords of Germany, as
the poorer citizens of the towns of Flanders?</p>

<p>Money, therefore, or its equivalent, and not the
title to the crown of France, was at the root of the
wars waged abroad by the English under Edward III.
The question of title simply served as pretext, covering
the baser objects of the invasion. No historical fact
is clearer, ignored though it has been in the popular
histories of England, than that the unpopularity of his
successor, Richard II., arose from his marriage with
the daughter of the King of France, and from his
desire for peace between the two kingdoms, of which
the marriage was the proof and the security. When
his wish for peace led to the formation of a war and
a peace party among the English nobility, Froissart
says: ‘The poorer knights and archers were of course
for war, as their sole livelihood depended upon it.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
They had learnt idleness and looked to war as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
means of support.’ In reference to the great peace
conference held at Amiens in 1391, he observes:
‘Many persons will not readily believe what I am
about to say, though it is strictly true, that the English
are fonder of war than of peace. During the reign of
Edward, of happy memory, and in the lifetime of his
son the Prince of Wales, they made such grand conquests
in France, and by their victories and ransoms
of towns, castles, and men gained such wealth, that
the poorest knights became rich; and those who were
not gentlemen by birth, by gallantly hazarding themselves
in these wars, were ennobled by their valour
and worth. Those who came after them were desirous
of following the same road.... Even the Duke of
Gloucester, son of King Edward, inclined to the opinion
of the commons, as did many other knights and
squires who were desirous of war to enable them to
support their state.’<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>No other country, indeed, pleased these English
brigand knights so well as France for the purpose of
military plunder. Hence the English who returned
from the expedition to Castile complained bitterly that
in the large towns where they expected to find everything,
there was nothing but wines, lard, and empty
coffers; but that it was quite otherwise in France,
where they had often found in the cities taken in war
such wealth and riches as astonished them; it was in
a war with France therefore that it behoved them to
hazard their lives, for it was very profitable, not in a
war with Castile or Portugal, where there was nothing
but poverty and loss to be suffered.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>With this evidence from Froissart may be compared
a passage from Philip de Commines, where he
says, in speaking of Louis XI. towards the end of the
following century: ‘Our master was well aware that
the nobility, clergy, and commons of England are
always ready to enter upon a war with France, not
only on account of their old title to its crown, but by
the desire of gain, for it pleased God to permit their
predecessors to win several memorable battles in this
kingdom, and to remain in possession of Normandy
and Guienne for the space of 350 years, ... during
which time they carried over enormous booty into
England. Not only in plunder which they had taken
in the several towns, but in the richness and quality
of their prisoners, who were most of them great princes
and lords, and paid them vast ransoms for their
liberty; so that every Englishman afterwards hoped
to do the same thereby and return home laden with
spoils.’<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, were the antecedents of the evil custom
of war which has descended to our own time; and
we shall have taken the first step to its abolition when
we have thus learnt to read its real descent and place
in history, and to reject as pure hallucination the idea
that in the warfare of the past any more than of the
present there was anything noble or great or glorious.
That brave deeds were often done and noble conduct
sometimes displayed in it must not blind us to its
other and darker features. It was a warfare in which
not even women and children were safe from the
sword or lance of the knight or soldier; nor sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
buildings exempt from their rage. It was a warfare
in which the occasional mercy shown had a mercenary
taint; in which the defeated were only spared
for their ransom; and in which prisoners were constantly
liable to torture, mutilation, and fetters.
Above all, it was a warfare in which men fought more
from a sordid greed of gain than from any love or
attachment to their king or country, so that all sense
of loyalty would speedily evaporate if a king like
Richard II. chanced to wish to live peaceably with his
neighbours.</p>

<p>It is not unimportant to have thus shown the
warfare of chivalry in its true light. For it is the
delusion with regard to it, which more than anything
else keeps alive those romantic notions about
war and warriors that are the most fatal hindrance to
removing both from the face of the earth. We clearly
drive militarism to its last defences, if we deprive it
of every period and of almost every name on which
it is wont to rely as entitling it to our admiration or
esteem.</p>

Marine Code of the future.</p>

<p>The first striking difference between military and
naval warfare is that, while&mdash;in theory, at least&mdash;the
military forces of a country confine their attacks to
the persons and power of their enemy, the naval
forces devote themselves primarily to the plunder
of his property and commerce. If on land the
theory of modern war exempts from spoliation all
of an enemy’s goods that do not contribute to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
military strength, on sea such spoliation is the professed
object of maritime warfare. And the difference,
we are told, is ‘the necessary consequence of the
state of war, which places the citizens or subject of
the belligerent states in hostility to each other, and
prohibits all intercourse between them,’<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> although the
very reason for the immunity of private property on
land is that war is a condition of hostility between
the military forces of two countries, and not between
their respective inhabitants.<a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Writers on public law have invented many ingenious
theories to explain and justify, on rational
grounds, so fundamental a difference between the
two kinds of warfare. ‘To make prize of a merchant
ship,’ says Dr. Whewell, ‘is an obvious way of showing
(such a ship) that its own State is unable to protect
it at sea, and thus is a mode of attacking the State;’<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
a reason that would equally justify the slaughter of
nonagenarians. According to Hautefeuille, the differences
flows naturally from the conditions of hostilities
waged on different elements, and especially from the
absence at sea of any fear of a rising <i>en masse</i> which,
as it may be the result of wholesale robbery on land,
serves to some extent as a safeguard against it.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>A simpler explanation may trace the difference
to the maritime Piracy which for many centuries
was the normal relation between the English and
Continental coasts, and out of which the navies of
Europe were gradually evolved. Sir H. Nicolas, de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>scribing
the naval state of the thirteenth and early
part of the fourteenth century, proves by abundant
facts the following picture of it: ‘During a truce or
peace ships were boarded, plundered, and captured
by vessels of a friendly Power as if there had been
actual war. Even English merchant ships were attacked
and robbed as well in port as at sea by English
vessels, and especially by those of the Cinque Ports,
which seem to have been nests of robbers; and,
judging from the numerous complaints, it would
appear that a general system of piracy existed which
no government was strong enough to restrain.’<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The governments of those days were, however, not
only not strong enough to restrain, but, as a rule, only
too glad to make use of these pirates as auxiliaries in
their wars with foreign Powers. Some English ships
carrying troops to France having been dispersed by a
storm, the sailors of the Cinque Ports were ordered
by Henry III., in revenge, to commit every possible
injury on the French; a commission undertaken with
such zeal on their part that they slew and plundered
not only all the foreigners they could catch, but their
own countrymen returning from their pilgrimages
(1242). During the whole reign of Henry IV. (1399-1413),
though there existed a truce between France
and England, the ordinary incidents of hostilities
continued at sea just as if the countries had been at
open war.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The object on either side was plunder
and wanton devastation; nor from their landing on
each other’s coasts, burning each other’s towns and
crops, and carrying off each other’s property, did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
country of either derive the least benefit whatever.
The monk of St. Denys shows that these pirates
were really the mariners on whom the naval service
of England chiefly depended in time of war, for he
says, in speaking of this period: ‘The English pirates,
discontented with the truce and unwilling to abandon
their profitable pursuits, determined to infest the sea
and attack merchant ships. Three thousand of the
most skilful sailors of England and Bayonne had confederated
for that purpose, and, as was supposed, with
the approbation of their king.’ It was not till the
year 1413 that Henry V. sought to put a stop to the
piratical practices of the English marine, and he then
did so without requiring a reciprocal endeavour on
the part of the other countries of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Maritime warfare being thus simply an extension
of maritime piracy, the usages of the one naturally
became the usages of the other; the only difference
being that in time of war it was with the licence and
pay of the State, and with the help of knights and
squires, that the pirates carried on their accustomed
programme of incendiarism, massacres, and robberies.</p>

<p>From this connection, therefore, a lower character
of warfare prevailed from the first on sea than on
land, and the spirit of piracy breathed over the waters.
No more mercy was shown by the regular naval
service than was shown by pirates to the crew of a
captured or surrendered vessel, for wounded and unwounded
alike were thrown into the sea. When the
fleet of Breton pirates defeated the English pirates
in July 1403, and took 2,000 of them prisoners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
they threw overboard the greater part of them;<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
and in the great sea-fight between the English and
Spanish fleets of 1350, the whole of the crew of a
Spanish ship that surrendered to the Earl of Lancaster
were thrown overboard, ‘according to the barbarous
custom of the age.’<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Two other stories of that time still further display
the utter want of anything like chivalrous feeling in
maritime usages. A Flemish ship, on its way to
Scotland, having been driven by a storm on the English
coast, near the Thames, and its crew having been
slain by the inhabitants, the king rewarded the assassins
with the whole of the cargo, and kept the ship and
the rigging for himself (1318).<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In 1379, when a fleet
of English knights, under Sir John Arundel, on its
way to Brittany, was overtaken by a storm, and the
jettison of other things failed to relieve the vessels,
sixty women, many of whom had been forced to
embark, were thrown into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The piratical origin, therefore, of the navies of
Europe sufficiently explains the fact that plunder,
which is less the rule than an incident of war on land,
remains its chief object and feature at sea. The fact
may further be explained by the survival of piracy
long sanctioned by the States under the guise of
Privateering. If we would understand the popularity
of wars in England in the old privateering days,
we must recall the magnificent fortunes which were
often won as prize-money in the career of legalised
piracy. During the war which was concluded in 1748<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, England captured
of French and Spanish ships collectively 3,434, whilst
she herself lost 3,238; but, small compensation as this
balance of 196 ships in her favour may seem after a
contest of some nine years, the pecuniary balance in
her favour is said to have amounted to 2,000,000<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>We now begin to see why our forefathers rang
their church bells at the announcement of war, as they
did at the declaration of this one against Spain. War
represented to large classes what the gold mines of
Peru represented to Spain&mdash;the best of all possible
pecuniary speculations. In the year 1747 alone the
English ships took 644 prizes; and of what enormous
value they often were! Here is a list of the values
which the cargoes of these prizes not unfrequently
reached:</p>

<ul><li>That of the ‘Héron,’ a French ship, 140,000<i>l.</i></li>
<li>That of the ‘Conception,’ a French ship, 200,000<i>l.</i></li>
<li>That of ‘La Charmante,’ a French East Indiaman, 200,000<i>l.</i></li>
<li>That of the ‘Vestal,’ a Spanish ship, 140,000<i>l.</i></li>
<li>That of the ‘Hector,’ a Spanish ship, 300,000<i>l.</i></li>
<li>That of the ‘Concordia,’ a Spanish ship, 600,000<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Two Spanish register ships are recorded to have
brought in 350<i>l.</i> to every foremast man who took
part in their capture. In 1745 three Spanish vessels
returning from Peru having been captured by three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
privateersmen, the owners of the latter received to
their separate shares the sum of 700,000<i>l.</i>, and every
common seaman 850<i>l.</i> Another Spanish galleon was
taken by a British man-of-war with a million sterling
in bullion on board.</p>

<p>These facts suffice to dispel the wonder we might
otherwise feel at the love our ancestors had for mixing
themselves up, for any pretext or for none, in hostilities
with Continental Powers. Our policy was naturally
spirited, when it meant chances like these for all
who lacked either the wit or the will to live honestly,
and returns like these on the capital invested in the
patriotic equipment of a few privateers. But what
advantage ultimately accrued to either side, after
deduction made for all losses and expenses, or how far
these national piracies contributed to the speedier
restoration of peace, were questions that apparently
did not enter within the range of military reasoning
to consider.</p>

<p>Everything was done to make attractive a life of
piracy spent in the service of the State. Originally
every European State claimed some interest in the
prizes it commissioned its privateers to take; but the
fact that each in turn surrendered its claim proves the
difficulty there was in getting these piratical servants
to submit their plunder to the adjudication of the
prize-courts. Originally all privateers were bound to
deliver captured arms and ammunition to their sovereign,
and to surrender a percentage of their gains to
the State or the admiral; but it soon came to pass
that sovereigns had to pay for the arms they might
wish to keep, and that the percentage deducted was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
first diminished and then abolished altogether. At
first 30 per cent. was deducted in Holland, which fell
successively to 18 per cent., to 10 per cent., to nothing;
and in England the 10 per cent. originally due to the
admiral was finally surrendered.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The crew also enjoyed
an additional prize of money for every person
slain or captured on an enemy’s man-of-war or privateer,
and for every cannon in proportion to its bore.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Of all the changes of opinion that have occurred in
the world’s history, none is more instructive than that
which gradually took place concerning privateering,
and which ended in its final renunciation by most of
the maritime Powers in the Declaration of Paris in
1856.</p>

<p>The weight of the publicists’ authority was for
long in its favour. Vattel only made the proviso of
a just cause of war the condition for reconciling privateering
with the comfort of a good conscience.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Valin defended it as a patriotic service, in that it relieved
the State from the expense of fitting out war-vessels.
Emerigon denounced the vocation of pirates
as infamous, while commending that of privateers as
honest and even glorious. And for many generations
the distinction between the two was held to be satisfactory,
that the privateer acted under the commission
of his sovereign, the pirate under no one’s but his
own.</p>

<p>Morally, this distinction of itself proved little.
Take the story of the French general Crillon, who,
when Henri III. proposed to him to assassinate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Duc de Guise, is said to have replied, ‘My life and
my property are yours, Sire; but I should be unworthy
of the French name were I false to the laws
of honour.’ Had he accepted the commission, would
the deed have been praiseworthy or infamous? Can
a commission affect the moral quality of actions?
The hangman has a commission, but neither honour
nor distinction. Why, then, should a successful privateer
have been often decorated with the title of
nobility or presented with a sword by his king?<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Historically, the distinction had even less foundation.
In olden times individuals carried on their own
robberies or reprisals at their own risk; but their
actions did not become the least less piratical when,
about the thirteenth century, reprisals were taken
under State control, and became only lawful under
letters of marque duly issued by a sovereign or his
admirals. In their acts, conduct, and whole procedure,
the commissioned privateers of later times differed in
no discernible respects from the pirates of the middle
ages, save in the fact of being utilised by the State for
its supposed benefit: and this difference, only dating
as it did from the time when the prohibition to fit out
cruisers in time of war without public authority first
became common, was evidently one of date rather
than of nature.</p>

<p>Moreover, the attempt of the State to regulate
its piratical service failed utterly. In the fourteenth
century it was customary to make the officers of a
privateer swear not to plunder the subjects of the
commissioning belligerent, or of friendly Powers, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
vessels sailing under safe-conducts; in the next century
it became necessary, in addition to this oath, to
insist on heavy pecuniary sureties;<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and such sureties
became common stipulations in treaties of peace.
Nearly every treaty between the maritime Powers
after about 1600 contained stipulations in restraint of
the abuses of privateering; on the value of which,
the complaints that arose in every war that occurred
of privateers exceeding their powers are a sufficient
comment. The numerous ordinances of different
countries threatening to punish as pirates all privateers
who were found with commissions from <i>both</i>
belligerents, give us a still further insight into the
character of those servants of the State.</p>

<p>In fact, so slight was the distinction founded on
the possession of a commission, that even privateers
with commissions were sometimes treated as actual
pirates and not as legitimate belligerents. In the
seventeenth century, the freebooters and buccaneers
who ravaged the West Indies, and who consisted of
the outcasts of England and the Continent, though
they were duly commissioned by France to do their
utmost damage to the Spanish colonies and commerce
in the West Indies, were treated as no better than
pirates if they happened to fall into the hands of the
Spaniards. And especially was this distinction disallowed
if there were any doubt concerning the legitimacy
of the letters of marque. England, for instance,
refused at first to treat as better than pirates the
privateers of her revolted colonists in America; and
in the French Revolution she tried to persuade the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Powers of Europe so to deal with privateers commissioned
by the republican government. Russia
having consented to this plan, its execution was only
hindered by the honourable refusal of Sweden and
Denmark to accede to so retrograde an innovation.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>An illusory distinction between the prize of a pirate
and that of a privateer was further sustained by the
judicial apparatus of the prize-court. The rights of a
captor were not complete till a naval tribunal of his
own country had settled his claims to the ships or
cargo of an enemy or neutral. By this device confiscation
was divested of its likeness to plunder, and a
thin veneer of legality was laid on the fundamental
lawlessness of the whole system. Were it left to
the wolves to decide on their rights to the captured
sheep, the latter would have much the same chance
of release as vessels in a prize-court of the captor.
A prize-court has never yet been equally representative
of either belligerent, or been so constituted as to be
absolutely impartial between either.</p>

<p>But, even granted that a prize-court gave its verdicts
with the strictest regard to the evidence, of what
nature was that evidence likely to be when it came
chiefly from the purser on board the privateer, whose
duty it was to draw up a verbal process of the circumstances
of every visit or capture, and who, as he was
paid and nominated by the captain of the privateer,
was dependent for his profits in the concern on the
lawfulness of the prizes? How easy to represent that
a defenceless merchant vessel had offered resistance
to search, and that therefore by the law of nations she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and her cargo were lawful prize! How tempting to
falsify every circumstance that really attended the
capture, or that legally affected the captors’ rights to
their plunder!</p>

<p>These aspects of privateering soon led unbiassed
minds to a sounder judgment about it than was discernible
in received opinion. Molloy, an English
writer, spoke of it, as long ago as 1769, as follows:
‘It were well they (the privateers) were restrained by
consent of all princes, since all good men account
them but one remove from pirates, who without any
respect to the cause, or having any injury done
them, or so much as hired for the service, spoil men
and goods, making even a trade and calling of it.’<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Martens, the German publicist, at the end of the same
century, called privateering a privileged piracy; but
Nelson’s opinion may fairly count for more than all;
and of his opinion there remains no doubt whatever.
In a letter dated August 7, 1804, he wrote: ‘If I had
the least authority in controlling the privateers, whose
conduct is so disgraceful to the British nation, I
would instantly take their commissions from them.’
In the same letter he spoke of them as a horde of
sanctioned robbers;<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and on another occasion he
wrote: ‘The conduct of all privateering is, as far as
I have seen, so near piracy, that I only wonder any
civilised nation can allow them. The lawful as well
as the unlawful commerce of the neutral flag is subject
to every violation and spoliation.’<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Yet it was for
the sake of such spoliation, which England chose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
regard as her maritime right and to identify with her
maritime supremacy, that, under the pretext of solicitude
for the liberties of Europe, she fought her long
war with France, and made herself the enemy in turn
of nearly every other civilised Power in the world.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Paris, the first article of which
abolished privateering between the signatory Powers,
was signed by Lord Clarendon on behalf of England;
but on the ground that it was not formally a treaty,
never having been ratified by Parliament or the Crown,
it has actually been several times proposed in the
English Parliament to violate the honour of England
by declaring that agreement null and void.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Lord
Derby, in reference to such proposals, said in 1867:
‘We have given a pledge, not merely to the Powers
who signed with us, but to the whole civilised world.’
This was the language of real patriotism, which
esteems a country’s honour its highest interest; the
other was the language of the plainest perfidy. In
November 1876, the Russian Government was also
strongly urged, in the case of war with England, to
issue letters of marque against British commerce, in
spite of the international agreement to the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
It is not likely that it would have done so; but these
motions in different countries give vital interest to
the history of privateering as one of the legitimate
modes of waging war.</p>

<p>Moreover, since neither Spain, the United States,
nor Mexico signed the Declaration of Paris, war with
any of them would revive all the atrocities and disputes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
that have embittered previous wars in which England
has been engaged. The precedent of former treaties,
such as that between Sweden and the United Provinces
in 1675, the United States and Prussia in 1785, and
the United States and Italy in 1871, by which either
party agreed in the event of war not to employ privateers
against the other, affords an obvious sample
of what diplomacy might yet do to diminish the
chances of war between the signatory and the non-signatory
Powers.</p>

<p>The United States would have signed the Declaration
of Paris if it had exempted the merchant
vessels of belligerents as well from public armed vessels
as from privateers: and this must be looked to as the
next conquest of law over lawlessness. Russia and
several other Powers were ready to accept the American
amendment, which, having at first only fallen
through owing to the opposition of England, was
subsequently withdrawn by America herself. Nevertheless,
that amendment remains the wish not only of
the civilised world, but of our own merchants, whose
carrying trade, the largest in the world, is, in the event
of England becoming a belligerent, in danger of
falling into the hands of neutral countries. In 1858
the merchants of Bremen drew up a formal protest
against the right of ships of war to seize the property
and ships of merchants.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> In the war of 1866
Prussia, Italy, and Austria agreed to forego this time-honoured
right of mutual plunder; and the Emperor
of Germany endeavoured to establish the same limitation
in the war of 1870. The old maxim of war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of which the custom is a survival, has long since
been disproved by political economy&mdash;the doctrine,
namely, that a loss to one country is a gain to
another, or that one country profits by the exact extent
of the injury that it effects against the property
of its adversary. Having lost its basis in reason, it
only remains to remove it from practice.</p>

<p>If we turn for a moment from this aspect of naval
warfare to the actual conduct of hostilities at sea, the
desire to obtain forcible possession of an enemy’s
vessels must clearly have had a beneficial effect in
rendering the loss of life less extensive than it was in
battles on land. To capture a ship, it was desirable, if
possible, to disable without destroying it; so that the
fire of each side was more generally directed against
the masts and rigging than against the hull or lower
parts of the vessel. In the case of the ‘Berwick,’ an
English 74-gun ship, which struck her colours to the
French frigate, the ‘Alceste,’ only four sailors were
wounded, and the captain, whose head was taken off by
a bar-shot, was the only person slain; and ‘so small a
loss was attributed to the high firing of the French,
who, making sure of the ‘Berwick’s’ capture, and
wanting such a ship entire in their fleet, were wise
enough to do as little injury as possible to her hull.’<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
The great battle between the English and Dutch
fleets off Camperdown (1795) was exceptional both
for the damage inflicted by both on the hulls of
their adversaries, and consequently for the heavy
loss of life on either side. ‘The appearance of the
British ships at the close of the action was very unlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
what it generally is when the French or Spaniards
have been the opponents of the former. Not a single
mast nor even a top-mast was shot away; nor were
the rigging and sails of the ships in their usual tattered
state. It was at the hulls of their adversaries that the
Dutchmen had directed their shot.’<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> As the English
naturally retaliated, though ‘as trophies the appearance
of the Dutch prizes was gratifying,’ as ships of
war ‘they were not the slightest acquisition to the
navy of England.’<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>When this happened, as it could not but often do
in pitched naval battles, the Government sometimes
made good to the captors the value of the prizes that
the serious nature of the conflict had caused them to
lose. Thus in the case of the six French prizes made
at the Battle of the Nile, only three of which ever
reached Plymouth, the Government, ‘in order that
the captors might not suffer for the prowess they had
displayed in riddling the hulls of the captured ships,
paid for each of the destroyed 74s, the “Guerrier,”
“Heureux,” and “Mercure,” the sum of 20,000<i>l.</i>, which
was as much as the least valuable of the remaining
74s had been valued at.’</p>

<p>It is curious to notice distinctions in naval warfare
between lawful and unlawful methods similar to those
conspicuous on land. Such projectiles as bits of iron
ore, pointed stones, nails, or glass, are excluded from
the list of things that may be used in <i>good war</i>; and
the Declaration of St. Petersburg condemns explosive
bullets as much on one element as on the other. Unfounded
charges by one belligerent against another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
are, however, always liable to bring the illicit method
into actual use on both sides under the pretext of
reprisals; as we see in the following order of the day,
issued at Brest by the French Vice-Admiral Marshal
Conflans (Nov. 8, 1759): ‘It is absolutely contrary to
the law of nations to make bad war, and to shoot
shells at the enemy, who must always be fought
according to the rules of honour, with the arms generally
employed by polite nations. Yet some captains
have complained that the English have used such
weapons against them. It is, therefore, only on these
complaints, and with an extreme reluctance, that it
has been resolved to embark hollow shells on vessels
of the line, but it is expressly forbidden to use them
unless the enemy begin.’<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>So the English in their turn charged the French
with making bad war. The wound received by
Nelson at Aboukir, on the forehead, was attributed
to a piece of iron or a langridge shot.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> And the
wounds that the crew of the ‘Brunswick’ received
from the ‘Vengeur’ in the famous battle between
the French and English fleets in June 1794, are said
to have been peculiarly distressing, owing to the French
employing langridge shot of raw ore and old nails,
and to their throwing stinkpots into the portholes,
which caused most painful burnings and scaldings.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
It is safest to discredit such accusations altogether,
for there is no limit to the barbarities that may come
into play, in consequence of too ready a credulity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Red-hot shot, legitimate for the defence of land
forts against ships, used not to be considered good
war in the contests of ships with one another. In the
three hours’ action between the ‘Lively’ and the ‘Tourterelle,’
a French privateer, the use by the latter of
hot-shot, ‘not usually deemed honourable warfare,’
was considered to be wrong, but a wrong on the part
of those who equipped her for sea more than on the
part of the captain who fired them.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The English
assailing batteries that fired red-hot shot against
Glückstadt in 1813 are said to have resorted to ‘a
mode of warfare very unusual with us since the siege
of Gibraltar.’<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The ‘Treatise on Tactics,’ by the Emperor Leo
VI., carries back the record of the means employed
against an enemy in naval warfare to the ninth century.
The things he recommends as most effective
are: cranes, to let fall heavy weights on the enemy’s
decks; caltrops, with iron spikes, to wound his feet;<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
jars full of quicklime, to suffocate him; jars containing
combustibles, to burn him; jars containing
poisonous reptiles, to bite him; and Greek fire with
its noise like thunder, to frighten as well as burn him.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Many of these methods were of immemorial usage;
for Scipio knew the merits of jars full of pitch, and
Hannibal of jars full of vipers.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Nothing was too bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
for use in those days; nor can it be ascertained when
or why they ceased to be used. Greek fire was used
with great effect in the sea-battles between the Saracens
and Christians; and it is a fair cause for wonder
that the invention of gunpowder should have so
entirely superseded it as to cause its very manufacture
to have been forgotten. Neither does history record
the date of, nor the reason for, the disuse of quicklime,
which in the famous fight off Dover in 1217
between the French and English contributed so greatly
to the victory of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that sentiments of humanity
should have caused these methods to be discarded
from maritime hostilities; but that such motives led
to a certain mitigation in the use of fire-ships appears
from a passage in Captain Brenton’s ‘Naval
History,’ where he says: ‘The use of fire-ships has
long been laid aside, to the honour of the nation which
first dispensed with this barbarous aggravation of the
horrors of war.’ That is to say, as he explains it,
though fire-ships continued to accompany the fleets,
they were only used in an anchorage where there was
a fair chance of the escape of the crew against which
they were sent; they ceased to be used, as at one
time, to burn or blow up disabled ships, which the
conqueror dared not board and carry into port, and
which were covered with the wounded and dying.
The last instance in which they were so used by
the English was in the fight off Toulon, in 1744; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
their use on that occasion is said to have received
merited reproach from an historian of the day.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>As the service of a fire-ship was one that required
the greatest bravery and coolness&mdash;since it was, of
course, attacked in every possible way, and it was
often difficult to escape by the boat chained behind
it&mdash;it displays the extraordinary inconsistency of
opinion about such matters that it should have been
accounted rather a service of infamy than of honour.
Molloy, in 1769, wrote of it as the practice of his day
to put to death prisoners made from a fire-ship:
‘Generally the persons found in them are put to death
if taken.’<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> And another writer says: ‘Whether it be
from a refined idea, or from the most determined
resentment towards those who act in fire-ships, may
be difficult to judge; but there is rarely any quarter
given to such as fall into the enemy’s power.’<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Clock-machines, or torpedoes, were introduced into
European warfare by the English, being intended to
destroy Napoleon’s ships at Boulogne in 1804. It is
remarkable that the use of them was at first reprobated
by Captain Brenton, and by Lord St. Vincent,
who foresaw that other Powers would in turn adopt
the innovation.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The French, who picked up some of
them near Boulogne, called them infernal machines.
But at present they seem fairly established as part of
good warfare, in default of any international agreement
against them, such as that which exists against explosive
bullets.</p>

<p>The same International Act which abolished pri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>vateering
between the signatory Powers settled also
between them two other disputed points which for
centuries were a frequent cause of war and jealousy&mdash;namely,
the liability of the property of neutrals to
be seized when found in the ships of an enemy, and
of the property of an enemy to be seized when found
in the ships of a neutral.</p>

<p>Over the abstract right of belligerents so to deal
with the ships or property of neutral Powers the publicists
for long fought a battle-royal, contending either
that a neutral ship should be regarded as neutral
territory, or that an enemy’s property was lawful prize
anywhere. Whilst the French or Continental theory
regarded the nationality of the vessel rather than of its
cargo, so that the goods of a neutral might be fairly
seized on an enemy’s vessel, but those of an enemy
were safe even in a neutral ship; the English theory
was diametrically the opposite, for the Admiralty restored
a neutral’s property taken on an enemy’s vessel,
but confiscated an enemy’s goods if found on a neutral
vessel. This difference between the English rule and
that of other countries was a source of endless contention.
Frederick II. of Prussia, in 1753, first resisted
the English claim to seize hostile property sailing
under a neutral flag. Then came against the same
claim the first Armed Neutrality of 1780, headed by
Russia, and again in 1801 the second armed coalition
of the Northern Powers. The difference of rule was,
therefore, as such differences always must be, a source
of real weakness to England, on account of the enemies
it raised against her all over the world. Yet the
Continental theory of free ships making free goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
was considered for generations to be so adverse to the
real interests of England, that Lord Nelson, in 1801,
characterised it in the House of Lords as ‘a proposition
so monstrous in itself, so contrary to the law of
nations, and so injurious to the maritime interests of
England, as to justify war with the advocates of such
a doctrine, so long as a single man, a single shilling,
or a single drop of blood remained in the country.’<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
The Treaty of Paris has made binding the Continental
rule, and in spite of Lord Nelson free ships now make
free goods.</p>

<p>The fact, therefore, that if England were now at
war with France she could not take French property
(unless it were contraband) from a Russian or American
ship, we owe not to the publicists who were
divided about it, nor to naval opinion which was
decided against it, but to the accidental alliance
between France and England in the Crimean war.
In order to co-operate together, each waived its old
claim, according to which France would have been
free to seize the property of a neutral found on Russian
vessels, and England to seize Russian property on the
vessels of a neutral. As the United States and other
neutral Powers as well would probably have resisted
by arms the claim of either so to interfere with their
neutrality, the mutual concession was one of common
prudence; and as the same opposition would have
been perennial, it was no great sacrifice on the part of
either to perpetuate and extend by a treaty at the
close of the war the agreement that at first was only
to last for its continuance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Much, however, as that treaty has done for the
peace of the world, by assimilating in these respects
the maritime law of nations, it has left many customs
unchanged to challenge still the attention of reformers.
It is therefore of some practical interest to consider of
what nature future changes should be, inasmuch as, if
we cannot agree to cease from fighting altogether, the
next best thing we can do is to reduce the pretexts for
it to as few as possible.</p>

<p>The reservation, then, in favour of confiscating
property that is contraband of war has left the right
of visiting and searching neutral or hostile merchantmen
for contraband untouched; though nothing has
been a more fruitful source of quarrel than the want
of a common definition of what constitutes contraband.
Anything which, without further manipulation,
adds directly to an enemy’s power, as weapons of war,
are contraband by universal admission; but whether
corn and provisions are, as some text-writers assert
and others deny; whether coined money, horses, or
saddles are, as was decided in 1863 between the
Northern Powers of Europe; whether tar and pitch
for ships are, as was disputed between England and
Sweden for 200 years; whether coal should be, as
Prince Bismarck claimed against England in 1870; or
whether rice is a war-threatening point of difference
between England and France in this very year of
grace; these are questions that remain absolutely undecided,
or are left to the treaties between the several
Powers or the arbitrary caprice of belligerents.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Paris was equally silent as to
the right (demanded by all the Powers save England)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
for ships of war, which have always been exempt from
search, to exempt from search also the merchant vessels
sailing under their convoy. So fundamental a divergence
between the maritime usages of different countries
can only be sustained under the peril of incurring
hostility and war, without any corresponding advantage
in compensation.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Paris has also left untouched
the old usage of embargoes. A nation wronged by
another may still seize the vessels of that other which
may be in its ports, in order to secure attention to its
claims; restoring them in the event of a peaceable
settlement, but confiscating them if war ensues. The
resemblance of this practice of hostile embargo to
robbery, ‘occurring as it does in the midst of peace
... ought,’ says an American jurist, ‘to make it
disgraceful and drive it into disuse.’<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> It would be as
reasonable to seize the persons and property of all the
merchants resident in the country, as used to be done
by France and England. In 1795, Holland, having
been conquered by France, became thereby an enemy
of England. Accordingly, ‘orders were issued to seize
all Dutch vessels in British ports;’ in virtue of which,
several gun-ships and between fifty and sixty merchant
vessels in Plymouth Sound were detained by the port
admiral.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> It is difficult to conceive anything less defensible
as a practice between civilised States.</p>

<p>It equally descends from the barbarous origin
of maritime law that all ships of an enemy wrecked on
our coast, or forced to take refuge in our harbours by
stress of weather or want of provisions, or in ignorance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of the existence of hostilities, should become ours by
right of war. There are generous instances to the
contrary. The Spanish Governor of Havana in 1746,
when an English vessel was driven into that hostile
port by stress of weather, refused to seize the vessel
and take the captain prisoner; and so did another
Spanish governor in the case of an English vessel
whose captain was ignorant that Honduras was hostile
territory. But these cases are the exception; the rule
being, that a hostile Power avails itself of a captain’s
ignorance or distress to make him a prisoner and his
ship a prize of war; another proof, if further needed,
how very little magnanimity really enters into the
conduct of hostilities.</p>

<p>It is a still further abuse of the rights of war that
a belligerent State may do what it pleases, not only
with all the vessels of its own subjects, but with all
those of neutrals as well which happen to be within
its jurisdiction at the beginning of a war; that it may,
on paying the owners the value of their freight beforehand,
confiscate such vessels and compel them to
serve in the transport of its troops or its munitions of
war. Yet this is the so-called <i>jus angariæ</i>, to which
Prince Bismarck appealed when in the war with France
the Germans sank some British vessels at the mouth
of the Seine.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> It is true we received liberal compensation,
but the right is none the less one which all the
Powers are interested in abolishing.</p>

<p>If, then, from the preceding retrospect it appears
that whatever advance we have made on the maritime
usages of our ancestors has been due solely to inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>national
agreement, and to a friendly concert between
the chief Powers of the world, acting with
a view to their permanent and collective interests,
the inference is evidently in favour of any further
advance being only possible in the same way. The
renunciations of each Power redound to the benefit
of each and all; nor can the gain of the world involve
any real loss for the several nations that compose
it. We shall therefore, perhaps, not err far from the
truth, if we imagine the following articles, in complement
of those formulated in Paris in 1856, to constitute
the International Marine Code which will be
found in the future to be most calculated to remove
sources of contention between nations, and best
adapted, therefore, to the permanent interests of the
contracting parties:</p>

<ol>

<li>Privateering is and remains abolished.</li>

<li>The merchant vessels and cargoes of belligerents
shall be exempted from seizure and confiscation.</li>

<li>The colonies of either belligerent shall be excluded
from the field of legitimate hostilities,
and the neutrality of their territory shall
extend to their ships and commerce.</li>

<li>The right of visiting and searching neutral or
hostile merchantmen for contraband of war
shall be abolished.</li>

<li>Contraband of war shall be defined by international
agreement; and to deal in such contraband
shall be made a breach of the civil law,
prohibited and punished by each State as a
violation of its proclamation of neutrality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></li>

<li>Except in the case of contraband as aforesaid,
all trade shall be lawful between the subjects
of either belligerent, since individuals are no
more involved in the quarrel between their
respective governments at sea than they are
on land.</li>

<li>The only limitation to commerce shall be so
effective a blockade of an enemy’s ports as
shall render it impossible for ships to enter or
leave them; and the mere notification that a
port is blockaded shall not justify the seizure
of ships that have sailed from, or are sailing
to, them in any part of the world.</li>

<li>The right to lay hostile embargoes on the ships
of a friendly Power, by reason of a dispute
arising between them, shall be abolished.</li>

<li>The right to confiscate or destroy the ships
of a friendly Power for the service of a
belligerent State, the <i>jus angariæ</i>, shall be
abolished.</li></ol>

<p>What, then, would remain for the naval forces of
maritime Powers to do? Everything, it may be
replied, which constitutes legitimate warfare, and
conforms to the elementary conception of a state
of hostility; the blockading of hostile ports, and all
the play of attack and defence that may be imagined
between belligerent navies. Whatsoever is more
than this&mdash;the plunder of an enemy’s commerce,
embargoes on his ships, the search of neutral vessels&mdash;not
only cometh of piracy, as has been shown, but
is in fact piracy itself, without any necessary connection
with the conduct of legitimate hostilities.</p>

<p>On no subject connected with the operations of war
has International Law come as yet to lamer conclusions
than concerning Military Reprisals, or the
revenge that may be fairly exacted by one belligerent
from the other for violation of the canons of honourable
warfare.</p>

<p>General Halleck, for instance, whilst as against an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
enemy who puts in force the extreme rights of war
he justifies a belligerent in following suit, denies the
right of the latter to do so against an enemy who
passes all bounds and conducts war in a downright
savage fashion. Whilst therefore, according to him,
the law of retaliation would never justify such acts as
the massacre of prisoners, the use of poison, or promiscuous
slaughter, he would consider as legitimate
reprisals acts like the sequestration by Denmark of
debts due from Danish to British subjects in retaliation
for the confiscation by England of the Danish fleet
in 1807, or Napoleon’s seizure of all English travellers
in France in retaliation for England’s seizure and
condemnation of French vessels in 1803.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> And a
French writer, in the same spirit, denies that the
French Government would have been justified in retaliating
on Russia, when the Czar had his French
prisoners of war consigned to the mines of Siberia.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The distinction is clearly untenable on any rational
theory of the laws of retributive justice. You
may retaliate for the lesser, but not for the greater
injury! You may check resort to infamous hostilities
by the threat of reprisals, but must fold your hands
and submit, if your enemy becomes utterly barbarous!
You may restrain him from burning your crops by
burning his, but must be content to go without redress
if he slays your wives and children!</p>

<p>How difficult the question really is appears from
the attempt made to settle it at the Brussels Conference
of 1874, when the following clauses formed part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of the original Russian project submitted to the consideration
of that meeting:</p>

<p><i>Section IV.</i> 69. ‘Reprisals are admissible in extreme
cases only, due regard being paid as far as
possible to the laws of humanity when it shall have
been unquestionably proved that the laws and customs
of war have been violated by the enemy, and
that they have had recourse to measures condemned
by the law of nations.’</p>

<p>70. ‘The selection of the means and extent of the
reprisals should be proportionate to the degree of
the infraction of the law committed by the enemy.
Reprisals that are disproportionately severe are contrary
to the rules of international law.’</p>

<p>71. ‘Reprisals should be allowed only on the
authority of the commander-in-chief, who shall likewise
determine the degree of their severity and their
duration.’</p>

<p>The delicacy of dealing with such a subject, when
the memories of the Franco-German war were still
fresh and green, led ultimately to a unanimous
agreement to suppress these clauses altogether, and
to leave the matter, as the Belgian deputy expressed
it, in the domain of unwritten law till the progress of
science and civilisation should bring about a completely
satisfactory solution. Nevertheless, the majority
of men will be inclined, in reference to this
resolution, to say with the Russian Baron Jomini, the
skilful President of that Military Council: ‘I regret
that the uncertainty of silence is to prevail with respect
to one of the most bitter necessities of war. If the
practice could be suppressed by this reticence, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
not but approve of this course; but if it is still to exist
among the necessities of war, this reticence and this
obscurity may, it is to be feared, remove any limits to
its existence.’</p>

<p>The necessity of some regulation of reprisals, such
as that contained in the clauses suggested at Brussels,
is no less attested by the events of the war of 1870
than by the customs in this respect which have at all
times prevailed, and which, as earlier in time, form a
fitting introduction to those later occurrences.</p>

<p>That the fear of reprisals should act as a certain
check upon the character of hostilities is too obvious
a consideration not to have always served as a wholesome
restraint upon military licence. When, for instance,
Philip II. of Spain in his war with the Netherlands
ordered that no prisoners of war should
be released or exchanged, nor any contributions be
accepted as an immunity from confiscation, the threat
of retaliation led to the withdrawal of his iniquitous
proclamation. Nor would other similar instances be
far to seek.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is evident that, as seldom as war
itself is prevented by consideration of the forces in
opposition, will its peculiar excesses, which constitute
its details, be restrained by the fear of retaliatory
measures; and inasmuch as the primary offence is more
often the creation of rumour than a proved fact, the
usual result of reprisals is, not that one belligerent
amends its ways, but that both belligerents become
more savage and enter on a fatal career of competitive
atrocities. In the wars of the fifteenth century
between the Turks and Venetians, ‘Sultan Mahomet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
would not suffer his soldiers to give quarter, but
allowed them a ducat for every head, and the Venetians
did the same.’<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> When the Duke of Alva was in
the Netherlands, the Spaniards, at the siege of Haarlem,
threw the heads of two Dutch officers over the
walls. The Dutch in return beheaded twelve Spanish
prisoners, and sent their heads into the Spanish
trenches. The Spaniards in revenge hung a number of
prisoners in sight of the besieged; and the latter in
return killed more prisoners; and so it went on
during all the time that Alva was in the country,
without the least improvement resulting from such
sanguinary reprisals.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> At the siege of Malta, the
Grand Master, in revenge for some horrible Turkish
barbarities, massacred all his prisoners and shot their
heads from his cannon into the Turkish camp.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In
one of the wars of Louis XIV., the Imperialist forces
having put to death a French lieutenant and thirty
troopers a few hours after having promised them
quarter, Feuquières, for reprisals, slew the whole
garrison of two towns that he won by surprise, though
the number so slain in each instance amounted to 650
men (1689).<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>To all these cases the question asked by Vattel
very pertinently applies: ‘What right have you to
cut off the nose and ears of the ambassador of a barbarian
who has treated your ambassador in that manner?’
The question is not an easy one to answer,
for we have no more right in war than in civil life to
punish the innocent for the guilty apart from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
ordinary accidents of hostilities, even if otherwise we
must dispense with redress altogether. To do so by
intention and in cold blood is ferocious, whatever the
pretext of justification, and is never worth the passing
gratification it affords. The citizens of Ghent, in
their famous war with the Earl of Flanders, not only
destroyed his house, but the silver cradle and bathing
tub he had used as a child and the very font in which
he had been baptized; but such reprisals are soon regretted,
and read very pitiably in the eyes of the
after-world.</p>

<p>It is pleasanter to record some instances where
abstinence from reprisals has not been without its
reward. It is said that Cæsar in Iberia, when, in spite
of a truce, the enemy killed many of his men, instead
of retaliating, released some of his prisoners and
thereby brought the foe to regard him with favour.
We read in Froissart that the Lisboners refrained
from retaliating on the Castilians, when the latter
mutilated their Portuguese prisoners; and the English
Government acted nobly when it refused to reciprocate
the decree of the French Convention (though that
also was meant as a measure of reprisals) that no
English or Hanoverian prisoner should be allowed
any quarter.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> But the best story of this kind is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
told by Herodotus of Xerxes the Persian. The Spartans
had thrown into a well the Persian envoys who
had come to demand of them earth and water. In
remorse they sent two of their nobles to Xerxes to
be killed in atonement; but Xerxes, when he heard
the purport of their visit, answered them that he
would not act like the Spartans, who by killing his
heralds had broken the laws that were regarded as
sacred by all mankind, and that, of such conduct as
he blamed in them, he would never be guilty himself.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>But the most curious feature in the history of
reprisals is the fact that they were once regarded as
justly exacted for the mere offence of hostile opposition
or self-defence. Grotius states that it was the
almost constant practice of the Romans to kill the
leaders of an enemy, whether they had surrendered or
been captured, on the day of triumph. Jugurtha
indeed was put to death in prison; but the more
usual practice appears to have been to keep conquered
potentates in custody, after they had been led in
triumph before the consul’s chariot. This was the
fate of Perseus, king of Macedonia, who was also
allowed to retain his attendants, money, plate, and
furniture;<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> of Gentius, king of Illyria;<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> of Bituitus,
king of the Arvernians. Prisoners of less distinction
were sold as slaves, or kept in custody till their friends
paid their ransom.</p>

<p>But in the mediæval history of Europe, in the
so-called times of chivalry, a far worse spirit prevailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
with regard to the treatment of captives. Godfrey of
Bouillon, one of the brightest memories of chivalry,
was responsible for the promiscuous slaughter of three
days which the Crusaders exacted for the six weeks’
siege which it had cost them to take Jerusalem (1099).
The Emperor Barbarossa had 1,190 Swabian prisoners
delivered to the executioner at Milan, or shot from
military engines.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Charles of Anjou reserved many
prisoners, taken at the battle of Beneventum, to be
killed as criminals on his entrance into Naples. When
the French took the castle of Pesquière from the
Venetians by storm, they slew all but three who
surrendered to the pleasure of the king; and Louis
XII., who counted for a humane monarch, though his
victims offered 100,000 ducats for their lives, swore
that he would neither eat nor drink till they were
hanged (1509).<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The indignation of the Roman Senate on one
occasion with a consul who had sold as slaves
10,000 Ligurian prisoners, though they had surrendered
at discretion,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> was a sentiment that never
affected the warriors of mediæval Christendom. A
surrender at discretion ceased to constitute a claim
for mercy. Where the pagan held it wrong to enslave,
the Christian never hesitated to kill. Froissart’s story
of the six citizens of Calais, whom Edward III. was
with difficulty restrained from hanging for the obstinate
siege which their town had resisted, throws a
light over the war customs of that time, which other
incidents of history abundantly confirm. The record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of the capitulations of cities or garrisons is no pleasant
one, but it is a record which must be touched upon,
in order that war and its still prevalent maxims may
be judged at their proper value. We need scarcely
travel further than the fifteenth century alone in
search of facts to place in its proper light this aspect
of martial atrocities.</p>

<p>When the town of Rouen surrendered to Henry
V. of England, the latter stipulated for three of the
citizens to be left to his disposal, of whom two
purchased their lives, and the third was beheaded
(1419).<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> When the same king the year following
was besieging the castle of Montereau, he sent some
twenty prisoners to treat with the governor for a
surrender; but when the governor refused to treat,
even to save their lives, and when, after a fearful
leave-taking with their wives and relatives, they had
been escorted back to the English army, ‘the King
of England ordered a gallows to be erected and
had them all hanged in sight of those within the
castle.’<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> When the English took the castle of
Rougemont by storm, and some sixty of its defenders
alive, with the loss of only one Englishman, Henry V.,
in revenge for his death, caused all the prisoners
to be drowned in the Loire.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> When Meaux surrendered
to the same king, it was stipulated that six
of its bravest defenders should be delivered up to
<i>justice</i>, four of whom were beheaded at Paris, and
its commander at once hung to a tree outside the
walls of the city (1422).<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Not that there was any special cruelty in the
English mode of warfare. They simply conformed to
the customs of the time, as we may see by reference
to the French and Burgundian wars into which they
allowed themselves to be drawn. In 1434, the garrison
of Chaumont ‘was soon so hardly pressed that
it surrendered at discretion to the Duke of Burgundy
(Philip the Good), who had upwards of 100
of them hanged;’ and as with the townsmen, so with
those in the castle.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Bournonville, who commanded
Soissons for the Duke of Burgundy, and whom Monstrelet
calls ‘the flower of the warriors of all France,’ was
beheaded at Paris, after the capture of the town, by
order of the king and council, and his body hung
to a gibbet, like a common malefactor’s (1414).<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
When Dinant was taken by storm by the Burgundians,
the prisoners, about 800, were drowned before
Bovines (1466).<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> When the town of Saint-frou surrendered
to the Duke of Burgundy, ten men, left to
the disposal of that warrior, were beheaded; and so
it fared also with the town of Tongres (1467).<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
After the storming and slaughter at Liège, before the
Duke of Burgundy (Charles the Bold) left the city,
‘a great number of those poor creatures who had hid
themselves in the houses when the town was taken
and were afterwards made prisoners, were hanged’
(1468).<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> At Nesle, most of those who were taken
alive were hung, and some had their hands cut off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
(1472).<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> After the battle of Granson, the Swiss retook
two castles from the French, and hung all the Burgundians
they found in them. They then retook the
town and castle of Granson, and ordered 512 Germans
whom the Burgundians had hung to be cut down,
and as many of the Burgundians as were still in
Granson to be suspended on the same halters (1476).
In the skirmishes that occurred in a time of truce on
the frontiers of Picardy, between the French king’s
forces and those of the Duke of Austria, ‘all the
prisoners that were taken on both sides were immediately
hanged, without permitting any, of what degree
or rank soever, to be ransomed’ (1481). And as a
climax to these facts, let us recall the decree of the
Duke of Anjou, who, when Montpellier was taken by
siege, condemned 600 prisoners to be put to death,
200 by the sword, 200 by the halter, and 200 by fire,
and who, but for the remonstrances of a cardinal and
a friar, would undoubtedly have executed his sentence.</p>

<p>Ghastly facts enough these! and a strange insight
they afford us into the real character of a profession
which, in the days when these things were its commonest
occurrences, was held to be the noblest of all,
but of which it is only too patent that its mainsprings
were simply the brigand’s love of plunder and of bloodshed.
One story may be quoted to show that in this
respect the sixteenth century was no improvement on
the fifteenth. In the war between the Dutch and the
Spaniards, the captain of Weerd Castle, having previously
refused to surrender to Sir Francis de Vere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
begged at last for a capitulation with the honours
of war; Vere’s answer was, that the honours of war
were halters for a garrison that had dared to defend
such a hovel against artillery. The commandant was
killed first, and the remaining 26 men, having been
made to draw black and white straws, the 12 who
drew the white straws were hanged, the thirteenth
only escaping by consenting to act as executioner of
the rest!<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that in the wars of the past
the axe and the halter have played as conspicuous a
part as the sword or the lance; a fact to which its
due prominence has not always been given in the
standard histories of military antiquities. It is surprising
to find how close to the glories of war lie the
sickening vulgarities of murder.</p>

<p>To the Duke of Somerset, the regent of England
for Edward VI., appears to be due the credit of instituting
a milder treatment of a besieged but surrendered
garrison than had been previously customary. For
De Thou, the historian, speaks of the admiration the
Duke received for sparing the lives of a Scotch garrison,
contrary to that ‘ancient maxim in war which declares
that a weak garrison forfeits all claim to mercy on
the part of the conquerors, when, with more courage
than prudence, they obstinately persevere in defending
an ill-fortified place against the royal army,’ or refuse
reasonable conditions.</p>

<p>But the ancient maxim lasted, in spite of this
better example, throughout the seventeenth and till late
into the eighteenth century, for we find Vattel even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
then thus protesting against it: ‘How could it be
conceived in an enlightened age that it was lawful to
punish with death a governor who has defended his
town to the last extremity, or who in a weak place
had the courage to hold out against a royal army?
In the last century this notion still prevailed; it was
looked upon as one of the laws of war, and is not
even at present totally exploded. What an idea! to
punish a brave man for having performed his duty.’<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>But not even yet is the notion definitely expunged
from the unwritten code of martial etiquette. The
original Russian project, submitted to the Brussels
Conference, proposed to exclude, among other illicit
means of war, ‘the threat of extermination towards
a garrison that obstinately holds a fortress.’ The
proposal was unanimously rejected, and that clause
was carefully excluded from the published modified
text! But as the execution of a threat is morally
of the same value as the threat itself, it is evident
that the massacre of a brave but conquered garrison
still holds its place among the laws of Christian
warfare!</p>

<p>This peculiar and most sanguinary law of reprisals
has always been defended by the common military
sophism, that it shortens the horrors of war. The
threat of capital punishment against the governor or
defenders of a town should naturally dispose them to
make a conditional surrender, and so spare both sides
the miseries of a siege. But arguments in defence of
atrocities, on the ground of their shortening a war,
and coming from military quarters, must be viewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
with the greatest suspicion, and, inasmuch as they
provoke reprisals and so intensify passion, with the
greatest distrust. It was to such an argument that
the Germans resorted in defence of their shelling the
town of Strasburg, in order to intimidate the inhabitants
and drive them to force General Uhrich to a
surrender. ‘The abbreviation,’ said a German writer,
‘of the period of actual fighting and of the war itself is
an act of humanity towards both parties;’<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> although
the savage act failed in its purpose and General
Werder had to fall back, after his gratuitous destruction
of life and property, on the slower process of a
regular siege. If their tendency to shorten a war be
the final justification of military proceedings, the
ground begins to slip from under us against the use
of aconitine or of clothes infected with the small-pox.
Therefore such a pretext should meet with prompt condemnation,
notwithstanding the efforts of the modern
military school to render it popular upon the earth.</p>

<p>In respect, therefore, to this law of reprisals, the
comparison is not to the credit of modern times as
compared with the pagan era. A surrender, which
in Greek and Roman warfare involved as a rule
personal security, came in Christianised Europe to
involve capital punishment out of motives of pure
vindictiveness. The chivalry so often associated
with the battle-field as at least a redeeming feature
fades on closer inspection into the veriest fiction
of romance. Bravery under any form has been the
constant pretext for capital reprisals. Edward I.
had William Wallace, the brave Scotch leader, exe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>cuted
on Tower Hill; and it has been observed by
one writer, as the facts already quoted prove, that the
custom of thus killing defeated generals ‘may be
traced through a series of years so connected and
extensive that we are not able to point out the exact
time when it ceased.’<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>A characteristic incident of this sort is connected
with the famous pacification of Guienne by Montluc
in 1562. Montluc had won Montsegur by storm,
and its commander had been taken alive. The latter
was a man of notorious valour, and in a previous
campaign had been Montluc’s fellow-soldier and
friend. For that reason many interceded for his life,
but Montluc decided to hang him, and simply on
account of his valour. ‘I well knew his courage,’ he
says, ‘which made me hang him.... I knew him
to be valiant, but that made me the rather put him
to death.’ What of your chivalry after that?</p>

<p>But Alexander the Great, whose career has been
the ideal of all succeeding aspirants to military fame,
dealt even more severely than Montluc with Betis,
the gallant defender of Gaza. When Gaza was at
last taken by storm, Betis, after fighting heroically,
had the misfortune to be taken alive and to be
brought into the presence of the conqueror. Alexander
addressed him thus: ‘You shall not die, Betis,
in the manner you wished; but make up your mind
to suffer whatever torture can be thought of against a
prisoner;’ and when Betis for all answer returned him
but the silence of disdain, Alexander had thongs fixed
to his ankles, and, himself acting as charioteer, drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
his yet living victim round the city, attached to his
chariot wheels; priding himself that by such conduct
he rivalled Achilles’ treatment of Hector.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>A valiant resistance was with Alexander always a
sufficient motive for the most sanguinary reprisals.
Arimages, who defended a fortified rock in Sogdia,
thought his position so strong that when summoned
to surrender, he asked tauntingly whether Alexander
could fly; and for this offence, when, unable to hold
out any longer, Arimages and his relations descended
to Alexander’s camp to beg for quarter, Alexander
had them first of all flogged and then crucified at the
foot of the rock they had so bravely defended.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
After the long siege of Tyre, Alexander had 2,000
Tyrians, over and above the 6,000 who fell during the
storming of that city, nailed to crosses along the
shore,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> perhaps in reprisal for a violation of the laws
of war&mdash;for Quintus Curtius declares that the Tyrians
had murdered some Macedonian ambassadors, and
Arrian, who makes no mention of the crucifixion,
declares that they slew some Macedonian prisoners
and threw them from their walls&mdash;but more probably
(since there were evidently different stories of the
Tyrians’ offence) on account simply of the obstinate
resistance they had offered to Alexander’s attack.</p>

<p>The Macedonian conqueror regarded his whole
expedition against Persia as an act of reprisals for the
invasion of Greece by Xerxes, 150 years before his
own time. When he set fire to the Persian capital
and palace, Persepolis, he justified himself against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Parmenio’s remonstrances on the ground that it was
in revenge for the destruction of the temples in Greece
during the Persian invasion;<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and this motive was
constantly present with him, in justification both of
the war itself and of particular atrocities connected
with it. In the course of his expedition, he came to
a city of the Branchidæ, whose ancestors at Miletus
had betrayed the treasures of a temple in their charge
to Xerxes, and had by him been removed from
Miletus to Asia. As Greeks they met Alexander’s
army with joy, and at once surrendered their city to
him. The next day, after reflection given to the
matter, Alexander had every single inhabitant of the
city slain, in spite of their powerlessness, in spite of
their supplications, in spite of their community of
language and origin. He even had the walls of the
city dug up from their foundation, and the trees of
their sacred groves uprooted, that not a trace of their
city might remain.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Nor can doubt be thrown on these deeds by the
fact that they are only mentioned by Quintus Curtius
and not by Arrian. The silence of the one is no proof
of the falsity or credulity of the other. Both writers
lived many centuries after Alexander, and were dependent
for their knowledge on the writings, then
extant but long since lost, of contemporaries and
eye-witnesses of the expedition to Asia. That those
witnesses often gave conflicting accounts of the same
event we have the assurance of either writer; but
since it is impossible to determine the degree of discretion
with which each made their selections from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the original authorities, it is only reasonable to regard
them both as of the same and equal validity.
Seneca, who lived before Arrian and who therefore
was equally conversant with the original authorities,
hardly ever mentions Alexander without expressions
of the strongest reprobation.</p>

<p>Cruelty, in fact, is revealed to us by history as the
most conspicuous trait in the character of Alexander,
though not in his case nor in others inconsistent with
occasional acts of magnanimity and the gleams of a
higher nature. This cruelty, however, taken in connection
with his undoubted bravery, calls in question
the truth of a remark made by Philip de Commines,
and supported, he affirmed, by all historians, that no
cruel man is ever courageous. The popular theory,
that inhumanity is more likely to be the concomitant
of a timid than of a daring nature, ignores altogether
the teaching of history and the conclusions of <i>à priori</i>
reasoning. For if our regard for the sufferings of
others is proportioned to our regard for our own
sufferings, inasmuch as our self-love is the foundation
and measure of our powers of sympathy, a man’s disregard
for the sufferings of others&mdash;in other words his
cruelty&mdash;is likely to be the exact reflection of his disregard
for suffering in his own person, or, in other
words, of his physical courage. Men, moreover, like
Cicero, of whom it was said by Livy that he was
better calculated for anything than for war, by their
very incapacity for positions where their humanity is
likely to be tested, are rarely exposed to those temptations
of cruelty in which men of a more daring temperament
naturally find themselves placed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>And accordingly we find, by reference to instances
which lie on the surface of history, that great bravery
and great cruelty have more often been united than
separate. In French history there is the cruelty of
Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy; of Montluc
and Des Adretz, the latter of whom made 30 soldiers
and their captain leap from the precipice of a strong
place they had defended, and of both of whom
Brantôme remarks that they were very brave but very
cruel.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> In Scotch history, it was David I. who, though
famed for his courage and humanity, suffered the sick
and aged to be slain in their beds, even infants to be
killed and priests murdered at the very altars.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> In
English history, it was Richard Cœur-de-Lion who had
5,000 Saracen prisoners led out to a large plain to be
massacred (1191).<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In Jewish history, it was King
David who, when he took Rabbah of the Ammonites,
‘brought forth the people that were therein and put
them under saws and harrows of iron and under axes
of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln;
and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of
Ammon.’<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> It is not therefore more probable that a
man famed for his intrepidity will not lend himself
to counsels or actions of cruelty than that another
deficient in personal courage will not be humane.</p>

<p>And here one cause is deserving of attention as
helping to explain the greater barbarity practised by
the modern nations in the matter of reprisals, than
that which was permitted by the code of honour which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
acted in restraint of them in the better periods of
pagan antiquity; and that is the change that has
occurred with regard to slavery.</p>

<p>The abolition of slavery, which in Western Europe
has been the greatest achievement of modern
civilisation, did not unfortunately tend to greater
mildness in the customs of war. For in ancient times
the sale of prisoners as slaves operated to restrain that
indiscriminate and objectless slaughter which has been,
even to cases within this century, the marked feature
of the battle-field, and more especially where cities or
places have been taken by storm. Avarice ceased to
operate, as it once did, in favour of humanity. In
one day the population of Magdeburg, taken by
storm, was reduced from 25,000 to 2,700; and an
English eye-witness of that event thus described it:
‘Of 25,000, some said 30,000 people, there was not a
soul to be seen alive, till the flames drove those that
were hid in vaults and secret places to seek death in
the streets rather than perish in the fire; of these
miserable creatures some were killed too by the
furious soldiers, but at last they saved the lives of
such as came out of their cellars and holes, and
so about 2,000 poor desperate creatures were left.’<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
‘There was little shooting, the execution was all
cutting of throats and mere house murders.... We
could see the poor people in crowds driven down the
streets, flying from the fury of the soldiers, who
followed butchering them as fast as they could,
and refused mercy to anybody; till, driving them
down to the river’s edge, the desperate wretches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
would throw themselves into the river, where thousands
of them perished, especially women and children.’<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to read this graphic description of a
stormed city without the suspicion arising in the mind
that a sheer thirst for blood and love of murder is a
much more potent sustainer of war than it is usual or
agreeable to believe. The narratives of most victories
and of taken cities support this theory. At Brescia,
for instance, taken by the French from the Venetians
in 1512, it is said that 20,000 of the latter fell to only
50 of the former.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> When Rome was sacked in 1527
by the Imperialist forces, we are told that ‘the soldiery
threw themselves upon the unhappy multitude,
and, without distinction of age or sex, massacred all
who came in their way. Strangers were spared as
little as Romans, for the murderers fired indiscriminately
at everyone, from a mere thirst of blood.’<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>But this thirst of blood was checked in the days
of slavery by the counteracting thirst of money; there
having been an obvious motive for giving quarter
when a prisoner of war represented something of
tangible value, like any other article of booty. The
sack of Thebes by Alexander, and its demolition
to the sound of the lute, was bad enough; but after
the first rage for slaughter was over, there remained
30,000 persons of free birth to be sold as slaves.
And in Roman warfare the rule was to sell as slaves
those who were taken prisoners in a stormed city;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and it must be remembered that many so sold were
slaves already.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> All who were unarmed or who laid
down their arms were spared from destruction, as well
as from plunder;<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and for exceptions to this rule, as
for instance for the indiscriminate and cruel massacre
committed at Illiturji in Spain, there was always at
least the pretext of reprisals, or some special military
motive.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Cicero, who lived to see the Roman arms triumphant
over the world and the conversion of the
Roman republic into a military despotism, found
occasion to deplore at the same time the debased standard
of military honour. He believed that in cruel
vindictiveness and rapacity his contemporaries had
degenerated from the customs of their ancestors, and
he contrasted regretfully the utter destruction of
Carthage, Numantia, and Corinth, with the milder
treatment of their earlier enemies, the Sabines,
Tusculans, and others. He adduced as a proof of
the greater ferocity of the war spirit of his day
the fact that the only term for an enemy was originally
the milder term of stranger, and that it was
only by degrees that the word meaning stranger came
to have the connotation of hostility. ‘What,’ he
asks, ‘could have been added to this mildness, to
call him with whom you are at war by so gentle
a name as stranger? But now the progress of time
has given a harder signification to the word; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
it has ceased to apply to a stranger, and has remained
the proper term for an actual enemy in arms.’<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Is a similar process taking place in modern warfare
with regard to the law of reprisals? It is a long
leap from ancient Rome to modern Germany; but to
Germany, as the chief military Power now in existence,
we must turn, in order to understand the law of reprisals
as it is interpreted by the practice of a country
whose power and example will make her actions
precedents in all wars that may occur in future.</p>

<p>The worst feature in reprisals is that they are indiscriminate
and more often directed against the innocent
than the guilty. To murder women and children, old
men, or any one else, on the ground of their connection
with an enemy who has committed an action
calling for retribution, can be justified by no theory
that would not equally apply to a similar parody of
justice in civil life. It is a return to the theory and
practices of savages, who, if they cannot revenge
themselves on a culprit, revenge themselves complacently
on some one else. For bodies of peasants to
resist a foreign invader by forming ambuscades or
making surprises against him, though his advance
is marked by fire and pillage and outrage, may be contrary
to the laws of war (though that point has never
been agreed upon); but to make such attacks the
pretext for indiscriminate murder and robbery is an
extension of the law of reprisals that was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
definitely imported into the military code of Europe
by the German invaders of France in 1870.</p>

<p>The following facts, offered in proof of this statement,
are taken from a small pamphlet, published
during the war by the International Society for Help
to the Wounded, and containing only such facts as
were attested by the evidence of official documents or
of persons whose positions gave them an exceptional
title to credit.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> At one place, where twenty-five francs-tireurs
had hidden in a wood and received the Germans
with a fusillade, reprisals were carried so far that
the curé, rushing into the streets, seized the Prussian
captain by the shoulders and entreated mercy for the
women and children. ‘No mercy’ was the only
reply.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> At another place twenty-six young men had
joined the francs-tireurs; the Baden troops took and
shot their fathers.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> At Nemours, where a body of
Uhlans had been surprised and captured by some
mobiles, the floors and furniture of several houses
were first saturated with petroleum and then fired
with shells.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The new theory also was imported into the military
code, that a village, by the mere fact of trying to
defend itself, constituted itself a place of war which
might be legitimately bombarded and, when taken,
subjected to the rights of war which still govern the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
fate of places taken by assault.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Nor let it be supposed
that those rights were not exercised as rigorously
as they ever have been by victorious troops.
At Nogent-sur-Seine, the Wurtemburg troops carried
their fury to the slaughter of women and children and
even of the wounded. And if the belief still lingers
that the German troops of the Emperor William
behaved otherwise towards the weaker sex than
their ancestors in Rome and Italy under the Constable
of Bourbon, let the reader refer to the experiences
of Clermont, Andernay, or Neuville.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Reprisals beget, of course, reprisals; and had the
French and German war been by any accident prolonged,
it is appalling to think of the barbarities that
would have occurred. ‘Threat for threat,’ wrote
Colonel R. Garibaldi to the Prussian commander at
Châtillon, in reference to the latter’s resolve to punish
the inhabitants of that place for the acts of some
francs-tireurs; ‘I give you my assurance that I will not
spare one of the 200 Prussians whom you know
to be in my hands.’<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> ‘We will fight,’ wrote General
Chanzy to the Prussian commander at Vendôme,
‘without truce or mercy, because it is a question now
not of fighting loyal enemies, but hordes of devastators.’<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Under the theory of legitimate reprisals, the Germans
resuscitated the custom of taking hostages.
The French having (in accordance with the still recognised
but barbarous rule of war) taken prisoners
the captains of some German merchant vessels, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Germans retaliated by taking twenty persons of respectable
position at Dijon, and nine at Vesoul, and
detaining them as hostages. Nor was this an uncommon
episode in the campaign: though the sending to
Germany as prisoners of war of French merchants,
magistrates, lawyers, and doctors, and the making
them answerable with their lives and fortunes for
actions of their countrymen which they could neither
prevent nor repress, was a revival in its worst form of
the theory of vicarious punishment, and a direction of
hostilities against non-combatants, which was a gross
violation of the proclamation of the Prussian king,
made at the beginning of the campaign (after the
common cant of the leaders of armies), that his forces
had no war to wage with the peaceable inhabitants of
France.</p>

<p>Even plunder enters into the German law of reprisals.
Remiremont in the Vosges had to pay
8,000<i>l.</i> because two German engineers and one soldier
had been taken prisoners by the French troops. The
usual forced military contributions which the victors
exacted did not exclude a system of pillage and
devastation that the present age fondly believed to
belong only to a past state of warfare. On December
5, 1870, a German soldier wrote to the <i>Cologne
Gazette</i>: ‘Since the war has entered upon its present
stage it is a real life of brigands we lead. For four
weeks we have passed through districts entirely
ravaged; the last eight days we have passed through
towns and villages where there was absolutely nothing
left to take.’ Nor was this plunder only the work
of the common military serfs or conscripts, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
miserable poverty might have served as an excuse,
but it was conducted by officers of the highest rank,
who, for their own benefit, robbed farms and stables
of their sheep and horses, and sacked country houses
of their works of art, their plate, and even of their
ladies’ jewels.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The world, therefore, at least owes this to the
Germans, that they have taught us to see war in
its true light, by removing it from the realm of romance,
where it was decked with bright colours and
noble actions, to the region of sober judgment, where
the soldier, the thief, and the murderer are seen in
scarcely distinguishable colours. They have withdrawn
the veil which blinded our ancestors to the
evils of war, and which led dreamy humanitarians to
believe in the possibility of <i>civilised warfare</i>; so that
now the deeds of shame threaten to obscure the deeds
of glory. In the middle ages it was the custom to declare
a war that was intended to be waged with special
fury by sending a man with a naked sword in one hand
and a burning torch in the other, to signify that the
war so begun was to be one of blood and fire. We
have since learnt that there is no need to typify by
any peculiar ceremony the character of any particular
war; for that the characteristics of all are the same.</p>

<p>The German general Von Moltke, in a published
letter wherein he maintained that Perpetual Peace
was a dream and not even a beautiful one, went on to
say, in defence of war, that in it the noblest virtues of
mankind were developed&mdash;courage, self-abnegation,
faithfulness to duty, the spirit of sacrifice; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
without wars the world would soon stagnate and lose
itself in materialism.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> We have no data from which
to judge of the probable state of a warless world, but
we do know that the brightest samples of these virtues
have been ever given by those who in peace and
obscurity, and without looking for lands, or titles, or
medals for their reward, have laboured not to destroy
life but to save it, not to lower the standard of morality
but to raise it, not to preach revenge but mercy, not to
spread misery and poverty and crime but to increase
happiness, wealth, and virtue. Is there or will there
be no scope for courage, for self-sacrifice, for duty,
where fever and disease are the foes to be combated,
where wounds and pain need to be cured or soothed,
or where sin and ignorance and poverty are the
forces to be assailed? But apart from this there is
another side to the picture of war, of which Von
Moltke says not a word, but of which, in the preceding
pages, some indication has been given. Now
that we are no longer satisfied with the dry narratives
of strategical operations, but are beginning to search
into the details of military proceedings; into the fate
of the captured, of the wounded, of the pursued;
into the treatment of hostages, of women, of children;
into the statistics of massacre and spoliation that are
the penalties of defeat; into the character of stratagems;
and into the justice of reprisals, we see war in
another mirror, and recognise that the old one gave
but a distorted reflection of its realities. No one ever
denied but that great qualities are displayed in war;
but the doubt is spreading fast, not only whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
it is the worthiest field for their display, but whether
it is not also the principal nursing-bed of the crimes
that are the greatest disgrace to our nature.</p>

<p>It is idle to think that our humanity will fail to
take its colouring from our calling. Marshal Montluc,
the bravest yet most cruel of French soldiers, was
fond of protesting that the inhumanity he was guilty
of was in corruption of his original and better nature;
and at the close of his book and of his life, he consoled
himself for the blood he had caused to flow like water
by the consideration, that the sovereigns whose servant
he had been were (as he told one of them) really
responsible for the misery he had caused. But does
the excuse avail him, or the millions who have succeeded
to his trade? A king or a government can
commission men to execute its policy or its vengeance;
but is a free agent, who accepts a commission that he
believes to be iniquitous, morally acquitted of his
share of culpability? Is his responsibility no greater
than that of the sword, the axe, or the halter with
which he carries out his orders; or does the plea
of military discipline justify him in acting with no
more moral restraint than a slave, or than a horse that
has no understanding? The Prussian officer who
at Dijon blew out his brains rather than execute some
iniquitous order<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> showed that he understood the dignity
of human nature as it was understood in the days
of the bygone moral grandeur of Rome. Such a man
deserved a monument far more than most to whom
memorial monuments are raised.</p>

<p>Recent events lend an additional interest to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
question of reprisals, and add emphasis to the necessity
of placing them, as it was sought to do at
Brussels, on the footing of an International Agreement.
It is sometimes said that dynastic wars belong
to the past, and that kings have no longer the power
to make war, as they once did, for their own pleasure
or pastime. There may be truth in this, though the
last great war in Europe but one had its immediate
cause in an inter-dynastic jealousy; but a far more
potent agency for war than ever existed in monarchical
power is now wielded by the Press. War in every
country is the direct pecuniary interest of the Daily
Press. ‘I know proprietors of newspapers,’ said
Cobden during the Crimean war, ‘who have pocketed
3,000<i>l.</i> or 4,000<i>l.</i> a year through the war as directly as
if the money had been voted to them in the Parliamentary
estimates.’<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The temptation, therefore, is
great, first to justify any given war by irrelevant
issues or by stories of the enormities committed by
the enemy, or even by positive false statements (as
when the English Press, with the <i>Times</i> at its head,
with almost one voice taught us that the Afghan ruler
had insulted our ambassador, and left us to find out
our mistake when a too ready credulity had cost us a
war of some 20,000,000<i>l.</i>); and then, when war has once
begun, to fan the flame by demanding reprisals for
atrocities that have generally never been committed
nor established by anything like proof. In this way
the French were charged at the beginning of the last
German war with bombarding the open town of
Saarbrück, and with firing explosive bullets from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
mitrailleuse; and the belief, thus falsely and purposely
propagated, covered of course with the cloak of reprisals
a good deal of all that came afterwards.</p>

<p>In this way has arisen the modern practice of justifying
every resort to war, not as a trial of strength
or test of justice between enemies, but as an act of
virtuous and necessary chastisement against criminals.
Charges of violated faith, of the abuse of flags of truce,
of dishonourable stratagems, of the ill-treatment or
torture of prisoners, are seized upon, regardless of any
inquiry into their truth, and made the pretext for
the indefinite prolongation of hostilities. The lawful
enemy is denounced as a rebel or a criminal, whom
it would be wicked to treat with or trust; and only
an unconditional surrender, which drives him to desperation,
and so embitters the war, is regarded as a
possible preliminary to peace. The time has surely
come when such a demand, on the ground of reprisals,
should cease to operate as a bar to peace. One of the
proposals at the Brussels Conference was that no
commander should be forced to capitulate under
dishonourable conditions, that is to say, without the
customary honours of war. It should be one of the
demands of civilisation that an unconditional surrender,
such as was insisted upon from Arabi in 1882
and led to the bombardment of Alexandria with all the
subsequent troubles, should under no circumstances be
insisted on in treating with an enemy; and that no
victorious belligerent should demand of a defeated
one what under reversed conditions it would consider
dishonourable to grant itself.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the state
of war is that of its connection with fraud, deceit, and
guile. If we may seek to obtain our ends by force,
we may surely, it is argued, do so by fraud; for what
is the moral difference between overcoming by superiority
of muscle and the same result obtained by dint
of brain? Lysander the Spartan went so far as to
say that boys were to be cheated with dice, but an
enemy with oaths; and if the world has professed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
horror at his sentiment, it has not altogether despised
his authority.</p>

<p>Among military stratagems the older writers used
to include every kind of deception practised by
generals in war, not only against the enemy, but
against their own troops; as, for instance, devices for
preventing or suppressing a mutiny, for stopping the
spread of a panic, or for encouraging them with false
news before or during an engagement.</p>

<p>But in modern use the term stratagem has almost
exclusive reference to artifices of deception practised
against an enemy; and the greater interest that attaches
to the latter kind of guile justifies the narrowed
denotation of the word. No one, for instance, would
now regard as a stratagem the clever behaviour of
that Thracian general Cosingas, who, acting also as
priest to his forces, brought them back to obedience
by the report he artfully propagated that certain long
ladders which he had caused to be made and fastened
together were intended to enable him to climb to
heaven, there to complain to Juno of their misconduct.
The false pretence that is involved in a stratagem is
addressed to the leaders of a hostile force, in order that
their fear or confidence, unduly raised by it, may be
played upon to the advantage of their more artful
opponents. In the consideration, therefore, of military
stratagems, or <i>ruses de guerre</i>, it is best to conform
entirely to the more restricted sense in which they are
understood in modern parlance.</p>

<p>The following stratagem is a good one to start
with. During the Franco-German War of 1870,
twenty-five franc-tireurs clothed themselves in Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
uniform, and by the help of that disguise killed several
Prussians at Sennegy near Troyes; and the deed was
made a subject of open boast in a French journal.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
Was the boast a justifiable or a shameful one?</p>

<p>Distinctly justifiable, if at least Grotius, the father
of our international law, is of any authority. The
reasoning of Grotius runs in this wise. There is a
distinction between conventional signs that are established
by the general consent of all the world and
those which are only established by particular societies
or by individuals; deception directed against the
former involves the violation of a mutual obligation,
and is therefore unlawful, whereas that against the
latter is lawful, because it involves no such violation.
Therefore, whilst it is wrong to deceive an enemy by
words or signs which by general consent are universally
understood in a given sense, it is not wrong to
overcome an enemy by conduct which involves no
violation of a generally recognised and universally
binding custom. Under conduct of the latter type
fall such acts as a simulated flight, or the use of an
enemy’s arms, his standards, uniform, or sails. A
flight is not an instituted sign of fear, nor have the
arms or colours of a particular country any universally
established meaning.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>And in spite of the sound of sophistry that accompanies
this reasoning, the teaching of international
law has not substantially swerved on this point from
the direction given to it by Grotius. In Cicero’s
opinion, although both force and fraud were resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
most unworthy of rational humanity, the one pertaining
rather to the nature of the lion and the other
to that of the fox, fraud was an expedient deserving
of more hatred than the other.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> But the teaching of
later times has tended to overlook this distinction.
Bynkershoek, that celebrated Dutch jurist who advocated
the use of poison as one of the fair modes of
employing force, declares it to be a matter of perfect
indifference whether stratagem or open force be employed
against an enemy, provided perfidy be absent
from the former. And Bluntschli, who is the German
publicist of greatest authority in our own day, expressly
includes among the lawful stratagems of war
the use of an enemy’s uniform or flag.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>If, then, we test the received military theory by
some actual experience, the following episodes of
history must challenge rather our admiration than
our blame, and stand justified by the most advanced
theories of modern international law.</p>

<p>Cimon, the Athenian admiral, having captured
some Persian ships, made his own men step into them
and dress themselves in the clothes of the Persians;
and then, when the ships reached Cyprus, and the
inhabitants of that island came out joyfully to welcome
their friends, they were of course more easily
defeated by their enemies.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Aristomachus, having taken some Cardian ships,
placed his own rowers in them and towed his own
ships behind them, as if they were being conducted
in triumph. When the Cardians came out to greet
their supposed victorious crews, Aristomachus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
his men fell upon them and succeeded in committing
great carnage.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Modern history supplies analogous cases. In
September 1800 an English crew attacked two ships
that lay at anchor at Barcelona, by forcing a Swedish
vessel to take on board some English officers, soldiers,
and sailors, and so obtaining a means of approach that
was otherwise impossible.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> And English naval historians
tell with pride, rather than with shame, how
in 1798 two English ships, the ‘Sibylle’ and the
‘Fox,’ by sailing under false colours captured three
Spanish gunboats in Manilla Roads. When the
Spanish guard-boat was sent to inquire what the
ships were, the pilot of the ‘Fox’ replied that they belonged
to the French squadron, and that they wished
to put into Manilla, for the recovery of the crews from
sickness. The English Captain Cooke was introduced
under the French name of Latour; and a conversation
ensued in which the ceremony of wishing success to
the united exertions of the Spaniards and French
against the English was not forgotten. Two Spanish
boats having then come to visit the vessels, their
crews were quickly handed below; and a party of
British sailors having changed clothes with them and
got into their boat, advanced to the gunboats, which
they captured without pulling a trigger.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion the same ‘Sibylle,’ which had
been taken from the French by Romney in 1794,
captured a large French vessel that lay at anchor, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
standing in under French colours, and only hoisting
her real ones when within a cable’s length of her
prize;<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> the only limit to such a stratagem on the sea
being the necessity for a ship to hoist her real flag
before proceeding to actual hostilities. A state of
war must surely play strange tricks with our minds
to make it possible for us to approve such infamous
actions as those quoted. There can be no greater
proof of the utter demoralisation it causes than that
such devices should have ever come to be thought
honourable; and that no scruples should have ever
intervened against the prostitution of a country’s flag,
the symbol of her independence, her nationality, and
her pride, to the shame of open falsehood. Antiquaries
dispute the correctness of the statement of
Polyænus that Artemisia, the Queen of Caria and
ally of Xerxes against Greece, hoisted Persian colours
when in pursuit of Greek ships, but a Greek flag to
prevent Greek ships from pursuing herself, because
they say that flags were not then in use; but undoubtedly
the custom is a very old one on the seas
of having a number of different flags on board a ship,
for the purpose either of more easily capturing a
weaker or of more easily escaping from a stronger
vessel than herself. The French, for instance, in
1337 plundered and burnt Portsmouth, after having
been suffered to land under the cover of English
banners.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Not only the vessels of pirates and privateers,
but the war vessels of the State, learned to sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
under colours that belied their nationality.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The
only limit to the stratagem of the false flag (to which
international custom gradually came to give the force
of law) came to be the necessity of hoisting the real
flag before proceeding to fire, a limitation that was
not of much moment after the successful deception
had brought a defenceless merchant vessel within the
reach of easy capture. And with regard to ships of
war, the cannon-shot by which one vessel replied to
the challenge of its suspected nationality by the other
came to be equivalent to the captain’s word of honour
that the flag which floated above the cannon he fired
represented the nationality of which it professed to
be the symbol. The flag itself might tell a lie, therefore
the cannon-shot oath must redeem it from suspicion.
Such are the extraordinary ideas of honour
and morality that the system of universal fear, distrust,
and hostility, by many thought to be so surpassingly
glorious, has caused to become prevalent upon the
ocean.</p>

<p>In spite, therefore, of Grotius, the above stratagems
must be considered as dishonourable; and that so
they are beginning to be considered is indicated by
the fact that at the Brussels Conference of 1874 the
use of an enemy’s flag or uniform was expressly
rejected from the category of fair military stratagems.
But the improvement is in spite of international law,
not in consequence of it.</p>

<p>There is an obvious distinction indeed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the above method of overcoming an enemy and
such favourite devices as ambuscades, feigned retreats,
night attacks, or the diversion of a defence to the
wrong point. But perhaps nothing in the history of
moral opinion is more curious than that even these
modes of deceit should have been, not by one people
or an unwarlike people, but by several people, and
one among them the most warlike nation known to
history, deliberately rejected as unfair and dishonourable
modes of warfare. The historical evidence on
this point appears to be quite conclusive, and is worth
recalling for the interest that cannot but attach to
one of the strangest but most neglected chapters in
the history of human ethics.</p>

<p>The Achæans, says Polybius, disdained even to
subdue their enemies with the help of deceit. In their
opinion a victory was neither honourable nor secure
that was not obtained in open combat by superior
courage. Therefore they esteemed it a kind of law
among them never to use any concealed weapons, nor
to throw darts from a distance, being persuaded that
an open and close conflict was the only fair method of
combat. For the same reason they not only made a
declaration of war, but sent notice each to the other
of their resolution to try the fortune of a battle, and
of the place where they were determined to engage.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>And in Ternate, one of the Molucca Islands, which
suffered such untold miseries after the Europeans had
discovered its spices and its heathenism, not only was
war never begun without being first declared, but
it was also customary to inform the enemy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
number of men and the amount and kind of weapons
with which it was intended to conduct hostilities.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>But the case of the Romans is by far the most
remarkable. Polybius, Livy, and Ælian all agree in
their testimony that for a long period of their history
the Romans refrained from all kinds of stratagem as
from a sort of military meanness; and their evidence
is corroborated by Valerius Maximus, who says that
the Romans, having no word in their language to
express a military ruse, were forced to borrow the
Greek word, from which our own word stratagem is
derived.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Polybius, who lived and wrote as late as
the second century before Christ, after complaining
that artifice was then so prevalent among the Romans
that their chief study was to deceive one another in
war and in politics, adds that, in spite of this degeneracy,
they still declared war solemnly beforehand,
seldom formed ambuscades, and preferred to fight man
to man in close engagement. So late as the year 172
<span class="small">B.C.</span> the elder senators regretted the lost virtue of their
ancestors, who refrained from such stratagems as night
attacks, counterfeit flights, and sudden returns, and
who sometimes even appointed the day of battle and
fixed the field of combat, looking for victory not from
fraud, but only from superiority in personal bravery.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
Ælian, too, declares that the Romans never resorted
to stratagems till about the end of the Second Punic
War; and truly the great Roman general, Scipio, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
took the name of Africanus, displayed a thorough
African skill in the use he made of spies and surprises
to bring that war to a successful issue.</p>

<p>With regard to night attacks the Macedonians
appear to have cherished similar feelings, since we find
Alexander refusing to attack Darius by night on the
ground that he did not wish to gain a stolen victory.
And with regard to close combat, something of the
old Roman and Achæan feeling was displayed in
Europe when first the crossbow, and in later times the
musket, rendered personal prowess of lesser importance.
Before the time of Richard I., when the crossbow
became the chief weapon in war, warriors, says
the Abbé Velley, were so free and brave that they
would only owe victory to their lance and their sword,
and everybody detested those perfidious arms with
which a coward under shelter was enabled to slay the
bravest.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> So said Montluc of the musket, which in
1523 had not yet, he says, superseded in France the
use of the crossbow: ‘Would to God this accursed
instrument had never been invented.... So many
brave and valiant men would not have met their
deaths at the hands very often of the greatest cowards,
who would not so much as dare look at the man whom
they knock down from a distance with their accursed
balls.’<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> And in the same spirit Charles XII. of
Sweden once bade his soldiers to come to close quarters
with the enemy without shooting, on the ground
that it was only for cowards to shoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Such ideas are, of course, dead beyond the hope of
recovery; but they are an odd commentary on our
conceit in the improved tone of our military code of
honour. We have long since learned to despise these
old-world notions of honour and courage, and to make
very few exceptions indeed to the newer doctrine of
Christendom, that in war anything and everything is
fair. But it is worth the pause of a moment to reflect
that such moral sentiments in restraint of the use of
fraud in war should have once had a real existence in
the world; that they should once have swayed the
minds of the most successful military nation that ever
existed, and stood by them till they had attained that
high degree of power which was theirs at the time of
the Second Punic War (217-199 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) In comparing
the code of military honour prevalent in pagan antiquity
with that of more recent times, it is but fair to
remember that the pagan nations of old recognised
some principles of action which were never dreamt of
in the best days of Christian chivalry; and that the
generals of the people who we are sometimes told
were a mere robber community would have had as
strong a feeling against the righteousness of a night
attack, a feigned retreat, or a surprise, as our modern
generals would have of an open violation of a truce or
convention.</p>

<p>The downward path in this matter is easy, and the
history of Rome after Scipio Africanus is associated
with a change of opinion concerning stratagems that
in no degree fell short of that subtlety of the Greeks,
Gauls, or Africans, which the Romans once regarded
as perfidy. Frontinus, who wrote a book on strata<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>gems
in the reign of Trajan, and still more Polyænus,
who wrote a large book on the same subject for the
Emperors Verus and Antoninus, appear to have
thought that no deceit was too bad to serve as a
good precedent for the conduct of war. Polyænus
not merely made a collection of some nine hundred
stratagems, but collected them for the express purpose
of their being of service to the Roman Emperors
in the war then undertaken against Parthia.
To the rulers of a people who had once regarded
even an ambuscade as beneath their chivalry he
brought as worthy of their recollection and study actions
which are an eternal stain on the memory of
those who committed them. Let us take for example
the devices he records for obtaining possession of
besieged places, remembering that from the moment
the chamade has been beaten, or any other sign been
given for a conference or parley between the contending
forces, a truce by tacit agreement is held to
suspend their mutual hostilities.</p>

<p>1. Thibron persuaded the governor of a fort in
Asia to come out to arrange terms, under an oath
that he should return if they failed to agree. During
the relaxation of guard that naturally ensued, Thibron’s
men took the fort by assault: and Thibron, reconducting
the governor according to his word, forthwith put
him to death.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>2. In the same way behaved Paches, the Athenian
general at Notium. Having got Hippias, the governor,
into his power under the same promise that
Thibron made, he took the place by storm, massacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
all he found in it, reconducted Hippias according to
his oath, and had him killed upon the spot.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>3. Autophrodates proposed a parley with the chiefs
of the Ephesian army, having previously ordered his
cavalry officers and other troops to attack the Ephesians
during the conference. The result was a signal
victory, and the capture or slaughter of a great number
of Ephesians.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>4. Philip of Macedon sent some envoys into a
Thracian city, and whilst the people all met in assembly
to hear the proposals of the enemy the King
of Macedon attacked and took the city.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>5. The Thracians, having been defeated by the
Bœotians, made a truce with them, for a certain
number of <i>days</i>, and attacked them one <i>night</i>, whilst
the enemy were engaged in making sacrifices. And
so dealt Cleomenes with the Argives; he made a
truce with them for seven days, and attacked them
the second night.</p>

<p>All these things are told by Polyænus, not only
without a word of disapproval, but apparently as
good examples for the conduct of a war actually in
progress. Such was the state of moral debasement
in which their long career of military success ultimately
landed the great Roman people.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is not for modern history to cast
stones at Paches or at Thibron. The Conference-stratagem
attained its highest development in the
practice of warfare in Christendom; so that Montaigne
declares it to have become a fixed maxim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
among the military men of his time (the sixteenth
century) never in time of siege to go out to a parley.
That great French soldier Montluc, whose autobiography
contained in his Commentaries displays so
curious a mixture of bravery and cruelty, of loyalty
and cunning, and is perhaps the best military book
by a military man that has been written since Cæsar,
tells us how once, whilst he was bargaining with the
governor of Sarvenal about the terms of a capitulation,
his men entered the place by a window on the other
side and compelled the governor to surrender at
discretion, and how on another occasion he sent his
soldiers to enter Mont de Marsan and put all they
met to the sword, whilst he himself was deluding the
governor with a parley. ‘The moments of a parley
are dangerous,’ he justly observes, ‘and then more
than ever should the besieged be careful in guarding
their walls, for it is the time when the besiegers,
fearful of losing by a capitulation the booty that
would be theirs if they took the place by storm, study
to avail themselves of the relaxation of vigilance
promoted by the truce to approach the walls with
greater facility and success.’ And the man who
wrote this as the experience of his time, and illustrated
it by the above accounts of his own practice,
rose to be a Marshal of France!</p>

<p>Some other examples of the same stratagem prove
how widely the custom entered into the warfare of
the European nations. The governor of Terouanne,
besieged by the forces of the Emperor Charles V.,
having forgotten in a negotiation for a capitulation
to stipulate for a suspension of arms, the town was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
surprised during the conference, pillaged, and utterly
destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> And Feuquières, a French general of
Louis XIV., and the writer of a book of military
memoirs which ran through several editions, tells us
how he surprised a place called Kreilsheim in 1688:
‘I could not have taken this place by force, surrounded
as it was with a wall and a strong enough castle; but
the colonel in command having been imbecile enough
to come outside the place to parley with me, without
exacting a promise from me to let him return, I
retained him and compelled him to order his garrison
to surrender itself prisoner of war.’<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> And he actually
quotes this to show that when it is necessary to take
a post, all sorts of means should be employed, provided
they do not dishonour the general who resorts
to them, as would the failure of his word to the
colonel have dishonoured himself had the colonel
demanded it of him.</p>

<p>A sounder sense of military honour was displayed
by the English general, Lord Peterborough, at the
siege of Barcelona in 1705. Don Velasco had promised
to capitulate within a certain number of days,
in the event of no succour arriving, and he surrendered
one gate as a proof of his sincerity. During the truce
involved in this proceeding, the German and Catalonian
allies of the English entered the town and
began that career of plunder and outrage which is the
constant reward and crown of such military successes.
Lord Peterborough undertook to prevent disorder in
the town, expel the allied soldiery, and return to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
position. He was taken at his word, acted up to his
word, and saved the honour of England. But what
of that of his allies?</p>

<p>It is a fine line that divides a stratagem from an
act of perfidy. Valerius Maximus denounces as an
act of perfidy the conduct of Cnæus Domitius, who,
having received the King of the Arverni as a guest
under the pretence of a colloquy, sent him by sea a
prisoner to Rome;<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> but it is not easy to distinguish
it from the actions of Montluc or Feuquières. Vattel
lays down the following doctrine on the subject: As
humanity compels us to prefer the gentlest means in
the prosecution of our rights, if we can master a
strong place, surprise or overcome an enemy by a
stratagem or a feint void of perfidy, it is better to
do so than to have resort to a bloody siege or the
carnage of a battle. He expressly excludes perfidy;
but might not Polyænus have defended it on precisely
the same humanitarian grounds as those by
which Vattel justifies the more ordinary stratagems?
Might not an act of perfidy equally prevent a siege or
a battle? If we are justified in contending for our
rights by force, it is hard to say that we may not do so
by fraud; but it is still harder to distinguish the kinds
and the limits of such fraud, or to say where it ceases
to be lawful.</p>

<p>And to this length did Polyænus apparently go, as
we see in the cases of downright perfidy which he
includes in his collection of stratagems. The Locrians
swore to observe a treaty with the Sicilians so long as
they trod the earth they then walked on, or carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
their heads on their shoulders: the next day they
threw away the heads of garlic which they had
carried under their cloaks on their shoulders, and the
earth they had strewn in their shoes, and began a
general massacre of the Sicilians.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The Campanians,
having agreed to surrender half their arms, cut them
in half, and so virtually surrendered nothing.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Paches,
the Athenian, says Frontinus, having promised personal
safety to his enemies on condition of their
laying down their arms, or as he termed it, their <i>iron</i>,
slew all those who, having laid down their arms, still
retained the <i>iron</i> clasps in their cloaks.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>By these means it is undoubtedly possible to gain
that advantage over your enemy which, according to
every theory of war, it is the paramount object of
hostilities to obtain; for it has been too often forgotten
that a nation’s honour and character, which an
enlightened patriotism should value higher than the
mere earth on which it feeds and treads, are sacrificed
and impaired whenever a treaty is taken by one of
the parties to it to have been made in another sense
from that which was clearly understood by both
parties to have constituted its spirit at the time of
making it. What a lasting stain rests, for instance,
on the memory of Francis I., who before signing the
Treaty of Madrid, by which he swore, in return for his
liberty, to restore the Duchy of Burgundy, and to
return a prisoner to Spain if he failed to do so, made
a formal protest beforehand, in the presence of some
friends, that the oath he was about to take was involuntary
and therefore void, and broke it the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
he was free! And this was the man whose memory
is associated with the famous saying after the battle
of Pavia: ‘All is lost save honour.’ What he really
said after that event, in a letter to his mother, was
this: ‘All is lost save my honour and my life, which
is safe,’ and the letter went on at length, much more
in keeping with the character of that monarch.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> His
life indeed he saved; his honour he never recovered.</p>

<p>It was agreed at the Brussels Conference that
resort to every possible method of obtaining information
about the forces or country of an enemy should
count as a fair military stratagem; and, indeed, with
the subject of the deceitful side of war the military
theory and treatment of Spies occupies no inconsiderable
place.</p>

<p>Vattel is again as good an exponent as we can
have of what international law teaches on this subject.
His argument is as follows: It is not contrary to the
law of nations to seduce one of the hostile side to
turn spy, nor to bribe a governor to deliver a town,
because such actions do not, like the use of poison or
assassination, strike at the common welfare and safety
of mankind. Such actions are the common episodes
of every war. But that they are not in themselves
honourable or compatible with a good conscience is
proved by the fact that generals who resort to such
means never boast of them; and, if they are at all
excusable, it is only in the case of a very just war,
when there is no other way of saving a country from
ruin at the hands of lawless conquerors. A sovereign
has no right to require the services of a spy from any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of his subjects, but he may hold out the temptation of
reward to mercenary souls; and if a governor is willing
to sell himself and offer us a town for money,
should we scruple to take advantage of his crime,
and to get without danger what we have a right to
get by force? At the same time a spy may rightly
be put to death, because it is the only way we have of
guarding against the mischief he may do us.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Frederick the Great of Prussia was a contemporary
of Vattel, and in November 1760 he published
some military instructions for the use of his generals
which, in the matter of spies, was based on a wider
practical knowledge of the matter than of course
belonged to the more pacific publicist. He classified
spies into ordinary spies, double spies, spies of distinction,
and spies by compulsion. By double spies he
meant spies who also pretended to be in the service
of the side they betrayed. By spies of distinction
he meant officers of hussars, whose services he had
found useful under the peculiar circumstances of the
Austrian campaign. When he could not procure
himself spies among the Austrians, owing to the careful
guard which their light troops kept round their
camp, the idea occurred to him, and he acted on it
with success, of utilising the suspension of arms that
was customary after a skirmish between hussars
to make those officers the means of conducting an
epistolary correspondence with the officers on the
other side. Spies by compulsion he explained in this
way: ‘When you wish to convey false information
to an enemy, you take a trustworthy soldier and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
compel him to pass to the enemy’s camp to report
there all that you wish the enemy to believe; you also
send by him letters to excite the troops to desertion.’
And in the event of its being impossible to obtain
information about the enemy, this distinguished child
of Mars prescribes the following: Choose some rich
citizen, who has land and wife and children, and
another man disguised as his servant or coachman,
who understands the enemy’s language. Force the
former to take the latter with him to the enemy’s camp
to complain of injuries sustained, threatening him that
if he fail to bring the man back with him after having
stayed long enough for the desired object, his wife
and children shall be hanged and his house burnt.
‘I was myself constrained,’ adds this great warrior,
‘to have recourse to this method, when we were
encamped at &mdash;&mdash;, and it succeeded.’<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Such were the military ethics of the great philosopher
and king, whose character in the closer intimacy
of biography proved so disagreeable a revelation to
Carlyle. Pagan antiquity might be searched in vain
for practice or sentiments more ignoble. Sertorius,
the Roman captain, was one of the greatest masters of
stratagem in the world, yet how different his language
from that of the Great Frederick! ‘A man,’ he said,
‘who has any dignity of feeling should conquer with
honour, and not use any base means even to save his
life.’</p>

<p>From the sentiments of Frederick the Great regarding
spies, let us pass to those of our own time.
From Lord Wolseley’s ‘Soldier’s Pocket-Book’ may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
gained some insight as to the manner in which a spy
in an enemy’s camp may correspond with the hostile
general. The best way, he suggests, is to send a
peasant with a letter written on very thin paper,
which may be rolled up so tightly as to be portable
in a quill an inch and a half long, and this precious
quill may be hidden in the hair or beard, or in a
hollow made at the end of a walking-stick. It is
also a good plan to write secret correspondence in
lemon-juice across a newspaper or the leaves of a
New Testament; it is then safe against discovery,
and will become legible when held before a fire or
near a red iron.</p>

<p>‘As a nation,’ says Lord Wolseley, ‘we are bred
up to feel it a disgrace even to succeed by falsehood;
the word spy conveys something as repulsive as slave;
we will keep hammering along with the conviction
that honesty is the best policy, and that truth always
wins in the long run. These pretty little sentiments
do well for a child’s copy-book, but a man who acts
upon them had better sheathe his sword for ever.’<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
Was there ever such a confession of the incompatibility
of the soldier’s calling with the precepts of
ordinary honour? For how not so, if he must so far
stoop from the ordinary level of moral rectitude as
to be ready to scorn honesty and to trifle with truth?
And then the question is, Had not a man better
sheathe his sword for ever, or rather not enter at all
upon a trade where he will have to regard the eternal
principles of right and wrong as so much pretty
sentiment only fit for the copy-book?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Since, therefore, we have the authority of Vattel,
of Frederick the Great, and of Lord Wolseley that
spies may or even must be employed in war, and
that, be the trickery or bribery never so mean that
procures their services, no discredit reflects itself upon
those generals who use them&mdash;it is impossible not to
notice it as one of the chief anomalies in existing
military usages that, although a general has an unlimited
right to avail himself of the services of a spy
or a traitor, the penalty for acting in either of the
latter capacities is death. The capital penalty is not
of itself any test of the moral character of the action
to which it is affixed, for the service of a fire-ship,
which demanded the most desperate bravery, used to
be undertaken in the face of capital punishment.
Moreover, some of the most famous names in military
history have not hesitated to act as spies. Sertorius
was honoured by Marius with the usual rewards of
signal valour for having learnt the language of the
Gauls and gone as a spy amongst them disguised in
their dress. The French general Custine entered
Mayence in the disguise of a butcher. Catinat spied
out the strength of Luxembourg in the costume of a
coal-heaver. Montluc entered Perpignan as a cook,
and only resolved never again to act as a spy because
the narrowness of his escape convinced him, not that
it was a service of too much dishonour, but a service
of too much danger.</p>

<p>The custom of killing spies is an old Roman
one,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and, indeed, seems to have prevailed all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
world over. Nevertheless there have been exceptions
even to that. Scipio Africanus had some Carthaginian
spies who were brought before him led through
the camp, and then dismissed under escort, and with
the polite inquiry whether they had examined everything
to their satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>The consul Lævinus is said to have dealt in the
same way with some spies that were taken, and so
did Xerxes by some Greek detectives. At the famous
siege of Antwerp in 1584-5, when a Brabant spy was
brought before the Prince of Parma, the latter gave
orders that he should be shown all the works connected
with the wonderful bridge that he was then
constructing across the Scheldt, and then sent him
back to the besieged city with these words: ‘Go and
tell those who sent you what you have seen. Tell
them that I firmly intend either to bury myself
beneath the ruin of this bridge or by means of it to
pass into your city.’</p>

<p>There is a clear middle course between both
extremes. Instead of being hung or shot or sent
away scot free, a spy might fairly be made a prisoner
of war. Suggestions in this sense were made at the
Brussels Conference on the Laws of War. The
Spanish delegate proposed that the custom of hanging
or shooting detected spies should be abolished,
and the custom be substituted of interning them as
prisoners of war during the continuance of hostilities.
The Belgian delegate proposed that in no case should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
they be put to death without trial; and it was even
sought to establish a distinction between the deserts
of the really patriotic and the merely mercenary spy.
The feeling in fact made itself clearly visible, that an
act of which a general might fairly avail himself
could not in common justice be regarded as criminal
in the agent. Between a general and a spy the
common-law rule of principal and agent plainly holds
good: ‘He who acts through another acts through
himself.’ In a case of espionage either both principal
and agent are guilty of a criminal act, or neither is.
If the spy as such violates the laws of war, so does
the general who employs him; and either deserves
the same punishment. Were it not so, a general who
should hire a bravo to assassinate an enemy would
incur no moral blame, nor could be held to act outside
the boundary of lawful and honourable hostilities.</p>

<p>In some other respects the Brussels Conference
displayed the vagueness of sentiment that prevails
about the use of spies in war. It was agreed between
all the Powers that no one should be considered as a
spy but one who secretly or under false pretences
sought to obtain information for the enemy in occupied
districts; that military men collecting such information
within the zone of hostile operations should
not be regarded as spies if it were possible to recognise
their military character; and that military men, and
even civilians, if their proceedings were open, charged
with despatches, should not, if captured, be treated as
spies; nor individuals who carried despatches or kept
up communications between different parts of an
army through the air in balloons. The German dele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>gate
proposed, with regard to balloons, that those
who sailed in them might be first of all summoned
to descend, then fired at if they refused, and if captured
be treated as prisoners, not as spies. The
rejection of his proposal implies that by the laws of
modern war a balloonist is liable to be shot as a spy;
so that, from the point of view of personal danger,
the service of a balloon becomes doubly heroic. The
Brussels Conference settled nothing, owing to the
withdrawal of England from that attempt to settle
by agreement between the nations the laws that
should govern their relations in war-time; but from
what was on that occasion agreed to or rejected may
be gathered the prevalent practice of European warfare.
Is it not then a little remarkable that for the
dangerous service of espionage a different justice
should be meted out to civilians and to military men;
and that a patriot who risks his life in a balloon
should also risk it in the same way as a spy, a
deserter, or a traitor?</p>

<p>But whatever be the fate of a spy, and in spite
of distinguished precedents to the contrary, men of
honour will always instinctively shrink from a service
which involves falsehood from beginning to end. The
sentiment is doubtless praiseworthy: but what is the
moral difference between entering a town as a spy
and the military service of winning it by surprise?
What, for instance, shall we think of the Spanish
officers and soldiers who, dressed as peasants and
with baskets of nuts and apples on their arms, gained
possession of Amiens in 1597 by spilling the contents
of their baskets and then slaying the sentinels as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
scrambled to pick them up?<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> What of the officers
who, in the disguise of peasants and women, and
concealing daggers and pistols, got possession of Ulm
for the Elector of Bavaria? What of the French
who, in Dutch costume, and by supplications in Dutch
to be granted a refuge from a pursuing enemy, surprised
a fort in Holland in 1672?<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> What of Prince
Eugene, who took the fortress of Breysach by sending
in a large force concealed in hay-carts under the conduct
of two hundred officers disguised as peasants?<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
What of the Chevalier Bayard, that favourite of legendary
chivalry, who, having learnt from a spy the whereabouts
of a detachment of Venetian infantry, went by
night to the village where they slept, and with his
men slew all but three out of some three hundred
men as they ran out of their houses?<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> What of
Callicratidas the Cyrenæan, who begged the commander
of a fort to receive four sick soldiers, and
sent them in on their beds with an escort of sixteen
soldiers, so that they easily overpowered the guards
and won the place for their general?<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> What of
Phalaris, who, having petitioned for the hand of a
commandant’s daughter, overcame the garrison by
sending in soldiers dressed as women servants, and
purporting to bear presents to his betrothed?<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> What
of Feuquières, who, whilst pretending to lead a German
force and praying for shelter from a snowstorm, affixed
his pétards to the gates of Neuborg, and, having taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the town, put the whole of the garrison of 650 men
to the sword?<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>In what respect do such actions which are the
everyday stratagems of a campaign, and count as
perfectly fair, differ from the false pretences which constitute
the iniquity of the spy? In this respect only&mdash;that
whilst he bears his danger alone, in the case of
a surprise the danger is distributed among numbers.</p>

<p>And, in point of fact, there was a time when the
service of a surprise and that of espionage were so far
regarded as the same that by the laws of war death
was not only the allotted portion of the captured spy
but of all who were caught in an endeavour to take a
place by surprise. The rule, according to Vattel, was
not changed, nor the soldiers who were captured in a
surprise regarded or treated as prisoners of war, till
the year 1597, when, Prince Maurice having failed in
an attempt to take Venloo by surprise, and having
lost some of his men, who were put to death for that
offence, the new rule that has since prevailed was
agreed upon by both sides for the sake of their future
mutual immunity from that peril.</p>

<p>The usual rule laid down to distinguish a bad
from a good stratagem is that in the latter there is
no violation of an expressly or tacitly pledged faith.
The violation of a conference, a truce, or a treaty has
always therefore been reprobated, however commonly
practised. But certain occurrences of history suggest
the feasibility of corresponding stratagems which
cannot be judged by so simple a formula and which
therefore are of still uncertain right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>The first stratagem of this kind that suggests
itself is that of forgery. Hannibal, having defeated
and slain the Roman general Marcellus, and thereby
become possessed of his seal, the Romans found it
necessary to despatch messages to all their garrison
towns that no more attention should be paid to orders
purporting to come from Marcellus. The precedent
suggests the use of forged despatches as a weapon of
war. To obtain in time of peace, for use in time of
war, the signatures of men likely to be hostile commanders,
would obviously be of immense military
service for purposes either of defence or aggression.
The stratagem would be dishonourable in the highest
degree; but, unfortunately, the standard of measurement
in such cases is rather their effectiveness than
their abstract morality.</p>

<p>The second stratagem of the sort is the stratagem
of false intelligence. To what extent is it lawful to
deceive an enemy by downright falsehood? The
Chevalier Bayard, ‘without fear or reproach,’ when
besieged by the Imperialists in Mézières, contrived
to make the enemy raise the siege by sending a
messenger with letters containing false information
destined to fall into the hands of the enemy. The
invention of the telegraph has increased the means of
deceiving the enemy by false intelligence, and was
freely so used in the Civil War of the United States.
It is said to be better to secure the services of a few
telegraph operators in a hostile country than to have
dozens of ordinary spies; and for this reason, according
to the eminent author of the ‘Soldier’s Pocket-Book’:
‘Before or during an action an enemy may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
be deceived to any extent by means of such men;
messages can be sent ordering him to concentrate
upon wrong points, or, by giving him false information,
you may induce him to move as you wish.’</p>

<p>Another stratagem is suggested by the conduct of
the Prince of Orange, who, having detected in one of
his own secretaries a spy in the service of the Prince
of Luxembourg, forced him to write a letter to the
latter containing such information as enabled himself
to effect a march he wished to conceal. Might
not, then, prisoners of war be used for the same
compulsory service? For a spy just as much as a
soldier is a recognised and accredited military agent,
and, if the former may be made the channel of falsehood,
why not the prisoner of war? The Romans
made use of the latter to acquire information about
their enemy’s plans, if in no other way, by torture or
the threat of it; the Germans forced some of their
French prisoners to perform certain military services
connected with carrying on their campaign&mdash;would
it be therefore unfair to make use of them as the
Prince of Orange made use of his secretary?</p>

<p>To such questions there is no answer from the
international law writers. Still less is there any authoritative
military doctrine concerning them, and,
if the stratagems in debate are excluded from ‘good’
war by the military honour of to-day, the above study
of warlike artifices has been made to little purpose if
it has not taught us how changeable and capricious
that standard is, and of what marvellous adjustment
it is capable.</p>

<p>It were a treat at which the gods themselves might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
smile to see and hear a moral philosopher and a
military officer brought into conference together concerning
the stratagems permissible in war. Let the
reader imagine them trying to distribute in just and
equal parts the due share of blame attaching severally
to the following agents&mdash;to the man who betrays his
country or his cause for gold, and the general who
tempts him to his crime or accepts it gladly; to the
man who serves as a spy, to the general who on the
one side sends or employs him as a spy, and to the
general who on the other side hangs him as a spy; to
the man who discovers the strength of a town in the
disguise of a butcher, and to his fellow-soldiers who
enter it disguised as peasants or under the plea of
shelter from sickness or a snowstorm; to the man
who gains an advantage by propagating false intelligence,
and the man who does so by the use of forged
despatches; the man who, like Scipio, plays at negotiations
for peace in order the better to spy out and
avail himself of an enemy’s weakness, and the man
who makes offers of treason to an enemy in order the
more easily to take him at a disadvantage&mdash;and the
conclusion will be not unlikely to occur to him, when
he shudders at the possible length and futility of that
imaginary disputation, that, whatever havoc is caused
by a state of war to life, to property, to wealth, to
family affections, to domestic honour, it is a havoc
absolutely incomparable to that which it produces
among the received moral principles of mankind.
The military code regarding the fair and legitimate
use of fraud and deception has nothing whatever in
common with the ordinary moral code of civil life, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
principles openly professed in it being so totally foreign
to our simplest rules of upright and worthy conduct
that in any other than the fighting classes of our
civilised societies they would not be advocated for
very shame, nor listened to for a moment without
resentment.</p>

<p>A missionary, seeing once a negro furrowing his
face with scars, asked him why he put himself to such
needless pain, and the reply was: ‘For honour, and
that people on seeing me may say, There goes a man
of heart.’</p>

<p>Ridiculous as this negro’s idea of honour must
appear to us, it bears a sufficient resemblance to other
notions of the same kind that have passed current in
the world at different times to satisfy us of the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
variability of the sentiment in question. Cæsar built
with difficulty a bridge across the Rhine, chiefly
because he held it beneath his own dignity, or the
Roman people’s, for his army to cross it in boats. The
Celts of old thought it as ignominious to fly from an
inundation, or from a burning or falling house, as to
retreat from an enemy. The Spartans considered it
inglorious to pursue a flying foe, or to be killed in
storming a besieged city. The same Gauls who
gloried in broadsword-wounds would almost go mad
with shame if wounded by an arrow or other missile
that only left an imperceptible mark. The use of
letters was once thought dishonourable by all the
European nations. Marshal Montluc, in the sixteenth
century, considered it a sign of abnormal overbookishness
for a man to prefer to spend a night in his study
than to spend it in the trenches, though, now, a contrary
taste would be thought by most men the mark
of a fool.</p>

<p>Such are some of the curious ideas of honour that
have prevailed at different times. Wherein we seem
to recognise not merely change but advance; one
chief difference between the savage and civilised state
lying in the different estimates entertained in either
of martial prowess and of military honour. We laugh
nowadays at the ancient Britons who believed that the
souls of all who had followed any other pursuit than
that of arms, after a despised life and an unlamented
death, hovered perforce over fens and marshes, unfit
to mingle with those of warriors in the higher and
brighter regions; or at the horsemen who used before
death to wound themselves with their spears, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to obtain that admission to Walhalla which was denied
to all who failed to die upon a battle-field; or at the
Spaniards, who, when Cato disarmed them, preferred
a voluntary death to a life destined to be spent without
arms.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> No civilised warrior would pride himself, as
Fijian warriors did, on being generally known as the
‘Waster’ or ‘Devastator’ of such-and-such a district;
the most he would look for would be a title and perhaps
a perpetual pension for his descendants. We
have nothing like the custom of the North American
tribes, among whom different marks on a warrior’s
robe told at a glance whether his fame rested on the
slaughter of a man or a woman, or only on that of a
boy or a girl. We are inferior in this respect to the
Dacota tribes, among whom an eagle’s feather with a
red spot on it denoted simply the slaughter of an
enemy, the same feather with a notch and the sides
painted red, that the said enemy had had his throat
cut, whilst according as the notches were on one side
or on both, or the feather partly denuded, anyone
could tell after how many others the hero had succeeded
in touching the dead body of a fallen foe. The stride
is clearly a great one from Pyrrhus, the Epirot king,
who, when asked which of two musicians he thought
the better, only deigned to reply that Polysperchon
was the general, to Napoleon, the French emperor,
who conferred the cross of the Legion of Honour on
Crescentini the singer.</p>

<p>And as the pursuit of arms comes with advancing
civilisation to occupy a lower level as compared with
the arts of peace, so the belief is the mark of a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
polished people that the rapacity and cruelty which
belong to the war customs of a more backward nation,
or of an earlier time, are absent from their own. They
invent the expression <i>civilised warfare</i> to emphasise a
distinction they would fain think inherent in the nature
of things; and look, by its help, even on the mode of
killing an enemy, with a moral vision that is absurdly
distorted. How few of us, for example, but see the
utmost barbarity in sticking a man with an assegai,
yet none whatever in doing so with a bayonet? And
why should we pride ourselves on not mutilating the
dead, while we have no scruples as to the extent to
which we mutilate the living? We are shocked at
the mention of barbarian tribes who poison their
arrows, or barb their darts, yet ourselves think nothing
of the frightful gangrenes caused by the copper cap in
the Minié rifle-ball, and reject, on the score of the
expense of the change, the proposal that bullets of
soft lead, which cause needless pain, should no longer
be used among the civilised Powers for small-arm
ammunition.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>But whilst the difference in these respects between
barbarism and civilisation is thus one that rather
touches the surface than the substance of war, the result
is inevitably in either state a different code of
military etiquette and sentiment, though the difference
is far less than in any other points of comparison
between them. When the nations of Christendom therefore
came in contact with unknown and savage races,
whose customs seemed different from their own and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
little worthy of attention, they assumed that the latter
recognised no laws of war, much as some of the
earlier travellers denied the possession or faculty of
speech to people whose language they could not
interpret. From which assumption the practical inference
followed, that the restraints which were held
sacred between enemies who inherited the same traditions
of military honour had no need to be observed
in hostilities with the heathen world. It is worth
while, therefore, to show how baseless was the primary
assumption, and how laws of war, in no way dissimilar
to those of Europe, may be detected in the military
usages of barbarism.</p>

<p>To spare the weak and helpless was and is a common
rule in the warfare of the less civilised races.
The Guanches of the Canary Islands, says an old
Spanish writer, ‘held it as base and mean to molest or
injure the women and children of the enemy, considering
them as weak and helpless, therefore improper
objects of their resentment; neither did they throw
down or damage houses of worship.’<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The Samoans
considered it cowardly to kill a woman:<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and in
America the Sioux Indians and Winnebagoes, though
barbarous enough in other respects, are said to have
shown the conventional respect to the weaker sex.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
The Basutos of South Africa, whatever may be their
customs now, are declared by Casalis, one of the
first French Protestant missionaries to their country,
to have respected in their wars the persons of women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
children, and travellers, and to have spared all prisoners
who surrendered, granting them their liberty on the
payment of ransom.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Few savage races were of a wilder type than the
Abipones of South America; yet Dobritzhoffer, the
Jesuit missionary, assures us not only that they thought
it unworthy of them to mangle the bodies of dead
Spaniards, as other savages did, but that they generally
spared the unwarlike, and carried away boys and
girls uninjured. The Spaniards, Indians, negroes, or
mulattoes whom they took in war they did not
treat like captives, but with kindness and indulgence
like children. Dobritzhoffer never saw a prisoner
punished by so much as a word or a blow, but he
bears testimony to the compassion and confidence
often displayed to captives by their conquerors. It
is common to read of the cruelty of the Red Indians
to their captives; but Loskiel, another missionary,
declares that prisoners were often adopted by the
victors to supply the place of the slain, and that even
Europeans, when it came to an exchange of prisoners,
sometimes refused to return to their own countrymen.
In Virginia notice was sent before war to the enemy,
that in the event of their defeat, the lives of all should
be spared who should submit within two days’ time.</p>

<p>Loskiel gives some other rather curious testimony
about the Red Indians. ‘When war was in contemplation
they used to admonish each other to hearken
to the good and not to the evil spirits, the former
always recommending peace. They seem,’ he adds
with surprise, ‘to have had no idea of the devil as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the prince of darkness before the Europeans came
into the country.’ The symbol of peace was the
burial of the hatchet or war-club in the ground; and
when the tribes renewed their covenants of peace,
they exchanged certain belts of friendship which were
singularly expressive. The principal belt was white,
with black streaks down each side and a black spot
at each end: the black spots represented the two
people, and the white streak between them signified,
that the road between them was now clear of all trees,
brambles, and stones, and that every hindrance was
therefore removed from the way of perfect harmony.</p>

<p>The Athenians used the same language of symbolism
when they declared war by letting a lamb
loose into the enemy’s country: this being equivalent
to saying, that a district full of the habitations of men
should shortly be turned into a pasture for sheep.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>The Fijians used to spare their enemy’s fruit trees;
the Tongan islanders held it as sacrilege to fight
within the precincts of the burial place of a chief,
where the greatest enemies were obliged to meet as
friends.</p>

<p>Most of the lower races recognise the inviolability
of ambassadors and heralds, and have well-established
emblems of a truce or armistice. The wish for peace
which the Zulu king in vain sought from his English
invaders by the symbol of an elephant’s tusk (1879),
was conveyed in the Fiji Islands by a whale’s tooth,
in the Sandwich by a young plantain tree or green
branch of the ti plant, and among most North
American tribes by a white flag of skin or bark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
The Samoan symbol for an act of submission in
deprecation of further hostilities conveys some indication
of the possible origin of these pacific symbols.
The conquered Samoan would carry to his victor
some bamboo sticks, some firewood, and some small
stones; for as a piece of split bamboo was the original
Samoan knife, and small stones and firewood
were used for the purpose of roasting pigs, this symbol
of submission was equivalent to saying: ‘Here
we are, your pigs, to be cooked if you please, and
here are the materials wherewith to do it.’<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In the
same way the elephant’s tusk or the whale’s tooth
may be a short way of saying to the victor: ‘Yours
is the strength of the elephant or the whale; we recognise
the uselessness of fighting with you.’</p>

<p>In the same way many savage tribes take the
greatest pains to impress the terms of treaties as
vividly as possible on the memory of the contracting
parties by striking and intelligible ceremonies. In
the Sandwich Islands a wreath woven conjointly by
the leaders of either side and placed in a temple was
the chief symbol of peace. On the Fiji Islands, the
combatant forces would meet and throw down their
weapons at one another’s feet. The Tahitians wove
a wreath of green boughs, furnished by each side;
exchanged two young dogs; and having also made
a band of cloth together, deposited the wreath and
the band in the temple, with imprecations on the side
which should first violate so solemn a treaty of peace.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
On the Hervey Islands, the token of the cessation of
war was the breaking of a number of spears against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a large chestnut tree; the almost imperishable coral
tree was planted in the valleys to signify the hope
that the peace might last as long as the tree; and
after the drum of peace had been solemnly beaten
round the island, it was unlawful for any man to carry
a weapon, or to cut down any iron-wood, which he
might turn into an implement of destruction.</p>

<p>Even our custom of proclaiming that a war is not
undertaken against a people but against its rulers is
not unknown in savage life. The Ashantee army
used to strew leaves on their march, to signify that
their hostility was not with the country they passed
through but only with the instigators of the war;
they told the Fantees that they had no war with them
collectively, but only with some of them.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> How
common a military custom this appeal to the treason
of an enemy is, notwithstanding the rarity of its
success, everybody knows. When, for instance, the
Anglo-Zulu war began, it was solemnly proclaimed
that the British Government had no quarrel with the
Zulu people; it was a war against the Zulu king, not
against the Zulu nation. (Jan. 11, 1879.) So were
the Ashantees told by the English invading force; so
were the Afghans; so were the Egyptians; and so
were the French by the Emperor William before his
merciless hordes laid waste and desolate some of the
fairest provinces of France; so, no doubt, will be
told the Soudan Arabs. And yet this appeal to
treason, this premium on a people’s disloyalty, is the
regular precursor of wars, wherein destruction for its
own sake, the burning of grain and villages for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
mere pleasure of the flames, forms almost invariably
the most prominent feature. The military view
always prevails over the civil, of the meaning of hostilities
that have no reference to a population but
only to its government. In the Zulu war, for instance,
in spite of the above proclamation, the lieutenant-general
ordered raids to be made into Zululand
for the express purpose of burning empty kraals or
villages; defending such procedure by the usual
military logic, that the more the natives at large felt
the strain of the war, the more anxious they would be
to see it concluded; and it was quite in vain for the
Lieutenant-Governor of Natal to argue that the burning
of empty kraals would neither do much harm to
the Zulus nor good to the English; and that whereas
the war had been begun on the ground that it was
waged against the Zulu king and not against his
nation, such conduct was calculated to alienate from
the invaders the whole of the Zulu people, including
those who were well disposed to them. Such arguments
hardly ever prevail over that passion for
wanton destruction and for often quite unnecessary
slaughter, which finds a ready and comprehensive
shelter under the wing of military exigencies.</p>

<p>The assumption, therefore, that savage races are
ignorant of all laws of war, or incapable of learning
them, would seem to be based rather on our indifference
about their customs than on the realities of the
case, seeing that the preceding evidence to the contrary
results from the most cursory inquiry. But
whatever value there may be in our own laws of war,
as helping to constitute a real difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
savage and civilised warfare, the best way to spread
the blessing of a knowledge of them would clearly be
for the more civilised races to adhere to them strictly
in all wars waged with their less advanced neighbours.
An English commander, for instance, should no more
set fire to the capital of Ashantee or Zululand for so
paltry a pretext as the display of British power than
he would set fire to Paris or Berlin; he should no
more have villages or granaries burnt in Africa or
Afghanistan than he would in Normandy; and he
should no more keep a Zulu envoy or truce-bearer in
chains<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> than he would so deal with the bearer of a
white flag from a Russian or Italian enemy.</p>

<p>The reverse principle, which is yet in vogue, that
with barbarians you must or may be barbarous, leads
to some curious illustrations of civilised warfare when
it comes in conflict with the less civilised races. In
one of the Franco-Italian wars of the sixteenth century,
more than 2,000 women and children took refuge
in a large mountain cavern, and were there suffocated
by a party of French soldiers, who set fire to a
quantity of wood, straw, and hay, which they stacked
at the mouth of the cave; but it was considered so
shameful an act, that the Chevalier Bayard had two
of the ringleaders hung at the cavern’s mouth.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Yet
when the French General Pélissier in this century
suffocated the unresisting Algerians in their caves, it
was even defended as no worse than the shelling of a
fortress; and there is evidence that gun-cotton was
not unfrequently used to blast the entrance to caves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
in Zululand in which men, women, and children had
hoped to find shelter against an army which professed
only to be warring with their king.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The following description of the way in which, in
the Ashantee war, the English forces obtained native
carriers for their transport service is not without its
instruction in this respect:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘We took to kidnapping upon a grand scale.
Raids were made on all the Assin villages within
reach of the line of march, and the men, and sometimes
the women, carried off and sent up the country under
guard, with cases of provisions. Lieutenant Bolton,
of the 1st West India Regiment, rendered immense
service in this way. Having been for some time
commandant of Accra, he knew the coast and many
of the chiefs; and having a man-of-war placed at his
disposal, he went up and down the coast, landing
continually, having interviews with chiefs, and obtaining
from them large numbers of men and women; or
when this failed, landing at night with a party of
soldiers, surrounding villages, and sweeping off the
adult population, leaving only a few women to look
after the children. In this way, in the course of a
month, he obtained several thousands of carriers.’<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>And then a certain school of writers talks of the
love and respect for the British Empire which these
exhibitions of our might are calculated to win from the
inferior races! The Ashantees are disgraced by the
practice of human sacrifices, and the Zulus have many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
a barbarous usage; but no amount of righteous indignation
on that account justifies such dealings with them as
those above described. If it does, we can no longer condemn
the proceedings of the Spaniards in the New
World. For we have to remember that it was not only
the Christianity of the Inquisition, or Spanish commerce
that they wished to spread; not mere gold nor
new lands that they coveted, but that they also strove
for such humanitarian objects as the abolition of barbarous
customs like the Mexican human sacrifices. ‘The
Spaniards that saw these cruel sacrifices,’ wrote a
contemporary, the Jesuit Acosta, ‘resolved with all
their power to abolish so detestable and cursed a
butchery of men.’ The Spaniards of the sixteenth
century were in intention or expression every whit as
humane as we English of the nineteenth. Yet their
actions have been a reproach to their name ever since.
Cortes subjected Guatamozin, king of Mexico, to
torture. Pizarro had the Inca of Peru strangled at
the stake. Alvarado invited a number of Mexicans to
a festival, and made it an opportunity to massacre
them. Sandoval had 60 caziques and 400 nobles
burnt at one time, and compelled their relations and
children to witness their punishment. The Pope
Paul had very soon (1537) to issue a bull, to the effect
that the Indians were really men and not brutes, as
the Spaniards soon affected to regard them.</p>

<p>The whole question was, moreover, argued out at
that time between Las Casas and Sepulveda, historiographer
to the Emperor Charles V. Sepulveda contended
that more could be effected against barbarism
by a month of war than by 100 years of preaching;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and in his famous dispute with Las Casas at Valladolid
in 1550, defended the justice of all wars undertaken
against the natives of the New World, either on
the ground of the latter’s sin and wickedness, or on
the plea of protecting them from the cruelties of their
own fellow-countrymen; the latter plea being one
to which in recent English wars a prominent place
has been always given. Las Casas replied&mdash;and his
reply is unanswerable&mdash;that even human sacrifices
are a smaller evil than indiscriminate warfare. He
might have added that military contact between
people unequally civilised does more to barbarise the
civilised than to civilise the barbarous population. It
is well worthy of notice and reflection that the European
battle-fields became distinctly more barbarous
after habits of greater ferocity had been acquired in
wars beyond the Atlantic, in which the customary
restraints were forgotten, and the ties of a common
human nature dissolved by the differences of religion
and race.</p>

<p>The same effect resulted in Roman history, when
the extended dominion of the Republic brought its
armies into contact with foes beyond the sea. The
Roman annalists bear witness to the deterioration that
ensued both in their modes of waging war and in the
national character.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> It is in an Asiatic war that we first
hear of a Roman general poisoning the springs;<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> in a
war for the possession of Crete that the Cretan captives
preferred to poison themselves rather than suffer
the cruelties inflicted on them by Metellus;<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Thracian war that the Romans cut off their prisoners’
hands, as Cæsar afterwards did those of the Gauls.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
And we should remember that a practical English
statesman like Cobden foresaw, as a possible evil
result of the closer relations between England and the
East, a similar deterioration in the national character
of his countrymen. ‘With another war or two,’ he
wrote, ‘in India and China, the English people would
have an appetite for bull-fights if not for gladiators.’<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Nor is there often any compensation for such
results in the improved condition of the tribes whom
it is sought to civilise after the method recommended
by Sepulveda. The happiest fate of the populations
he wished to see civilised by the sword was where they
anticipated their extermination or slavery by a sort of
voluntary suicide. In Cuba, we are told that ‘they
put themselves to death, whole families doing so
together, and villages inviting other villages to join
them in a departure from a world that was no longer
tolerable.’<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> And so it was in the other hemisphere;
the Ladrone islanders, reduced by the sword and the
diseases of the Spaniards, took measures intentionally
to diminish their numbers and to check population,
preferring voluntary extinction to the foul mercies of
the Jesuits: till now a lepers’ hospital is the only
building left on what was once one of the most
populous of their islands.</p>

<p>It must, however, be admitted in justice to the
Spaniards, that the principles which governed their
dealings with heathen races infected more or less the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
conduct of colonists of all nationalities. A real or
more often a pretended zeal for the welfare of native
tribes came among all Christian nations to co-exist
with the doctrine, that in case of conflict with them
the common restraints of war might be put in abeyance.
What, for instance, can be worse than this, told
of the early English settlers in America by one of
themselves? ‘The Plymouth men came in the mean
time to Weymouth, and there pretended to feast the
savages of those parts, bringing with them forks and
things for the purpose, which they set before the
savages. They ate thereof without any suspicion of
any mischief, who were taken upon a watchword
given, and with their own knives hanging about their
necks were by the Plymouth planters stabbed and
slain.’<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Among the early English settlers it soon came to
be thought, says Mather, a religious act to kill an
Indian. In the latter half of the seventeenth century
both the French and English authorities adopted the
custom of scalping and of offering rewards for the
scalps of their Indian enemies. In 1690 the most
healthy and vigorous Indians taken by the French
‘were sold in Canada, the weaker were sacrificed and
scalped, and for every scalp they had a premium.’<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
Caleb Lyman, who afterwards became an elder of a
church at Boston, left an account of the way in which
he himself and five Indians surprised a wigwam, and
scalped six of the seven persons inside, so that each
might receive the promised reward. On their petition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
to the great and general court they received 30<i>l.</i>
each, and Penhallow says not only that they probably
expected eight times as much, but that at the time of
writing the province would have readily paid a sum
of 800<i>l.</i> for a similar service.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Captain Lovewell, says
the same contemporary eulogist of the war that lasted
from July 1722 to December 1725, ‘from Dunstable
with thirty volunteers went northward, who marching
several miles up country came on a wigwam where
were two Indians, one of whom they killed and the
other took, for which they received the promised
bounty of 100<i>l.</i> a scalp, and two shillings and sixpence
a day besides.’ (December 19, 1724.)<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> At the surprise
of Norridjwock ‘the number of dead which
we scalped were 26, besides Mr. Rasle the Jesuit, who
was a bloody incendiary.’<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> It is evident that these
very liberal rewards must have operated as a frequent
cause of Indian wars, and made the colonists open-eared
to tales of native outrages; indeed the whites
sometimes disguised themselves like Indians, and
robbed like Indians, in order, it would appear, the
more effectually to raise the war-cry against them.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Since the Spaniards first trained bloodhounds
in Cuba to hunt the Indians, the alliance between
soldiers and dogs has been a favourite one in barbarian
warfare. The Portuguese used them in Brazil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
when they hunted the natives for slaves.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> And
an English officer in a treatise he wrote in the last
century as a sort of military guide to Indian warfare
suggested coolly: ‘Every light horseman ought to be
provided with a bloodhound, which would be useful
to find out the enemy’s ambushes and to follow their
tracks. They would seize the naked savages, and
at least give time to the horsemen to come up with
them.’<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> In the Molucca Islands the use of two bloodhounds
against a native chief was the cause of a great
confederacy between all the islands to shake off the
Spanish and Portuguese yoke.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> And even in the war
waged by the United States in Florida from 1838 to
1840, General Taylor was authorised to send to Cuba
for bloodhounds to scent out the Indians; nor, according
to one account, was their aid resorted to in vain.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Poison too has been called in aid. Speaking of
the Yuta Indians, a traveller assures us that ‘as in
Australia, arsenic and corrosive sublimate in springs
and provisions have diminished their number.’<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> And
in the same way ‘poisoned rum helped to exterminate
the Tasmanians.’<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>But there is worse yet in this direction. The
Portuguese in Brazil, when the importation of slaves
from Africa rendered the capture of the natives less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
desirable than their extermination, left the clothes of
persons who had died of small-pox or scarlet fever to
be found by them in the woods.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> And the caravan
traders from the Missouri to Santa Fé are said by the
same method or in presents of tobacco to have communicated
the small-pox to the Indian tribes of that
district in 1831.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> The enormous depopulation of
most tribes by the small-pox since their acquaintance
with the whites is one of the most remarkable results
in the history of their mutual connection; nor is it
likely ever to be known to what extent the coincidence
was accidental.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to turn from these practical illustrations
of the theory that no laws of war need be regarded
in hostilities with savage tribes to the only recorded
trial of a contrary system, and to find, not only that it
is associated with one of the greatest names in English
history, but also that the success it met with fully
justifies the suspicion and disfavour with which the
commoner usage is beginning to be regarded. The
Indians with whom Penn made his famous treaty in
1682 (of which Voltaire said that it was the only treaty
that was never ratified by an oath, and the only treaty
that was never broken), were of the same Algonquin
race with whom the Dutch had scarcely ever kept at
peace, and against whom they had warred in the
customary ruthless fashion of those times. The
treaty was based on the principle of an adjustment
of differences by a tribunal of an equal number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Red men and of White. ‘Penn,’ says the historian,
‘came without arms; he declared his purpose to
abstain from violence, he had no message but peace,
and not one drop of Quaker blood was ever shed by
an Indian’<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> For more than seventy years, from 1682
to 1754, when the French war broke out, in short,
during the whole time that the Quakers had the principal
share in the government of Pennsylvania, the
history of the Indians and Whites in that province
was free from the tale of murders and hostilities that
was so common in other districts; so that the single
instance in which the experiment of equal laws and
forbearance has been patiently persevered in, can at
least boast of a success that in support of the contrary
system it were very difficult to find for an equal
number of years in any other part of the world.</p>

<p>It may also be said against Sepulveda’s doctrine,
that the habits of a higher civilisation, where they are
really worth spreading, spread more easily and with
more permanent effect among barbarous neighbours
by the mere contagion of a better example than by
the teaching of fire and sword. Some of the Dyak
tribes in Borneo are said to have given up human
sacrifices from the better influences of the Malays
on the coast district.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The Peruvians, according to
Prescott, spread their civilisation among their ruder
neighbours more by example than by force. ‘Far
from provoking hostilities, they allowed time for the
salutary example of their own institutions to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
its effect, trusting that their less civilised neighbours
would submit to their sceptre from a conviction of
the blessings it would secure to them.’ They exhorted
them to lay aside their cannibalism, their human
sacrifices, and their other barbarities; they employed
negotiation, conciliatory treatment, and presents to
leading men among the tribes; and only if all these
means failed did they resort to war, but to war which
at every stage was readily open to propositions of
peace, and in which any unnecessary outrage on the
persons or property of their enemy was punished with
death.</p>

<p>Something will have been done for the cause of
this better method of civilising the lower races, if we
forewarn and forearm ourselves against the symptoms
of hostilities with them by a thorough understanding
of the conditions which render such hostilities probable.
For as an outbreak of fever is to some extent
preventable by a knowledge of the conditions which
make for fevers, so may the outbreak of war be
averted by a knowledge of the laws which govern
their appearance. The experience which we owe to
history in this respect is amply sufficient to enable us
to generalise with some degree of confidence and
certainty as to the causes or steps which produce
wars or precede them; and from the remembrance of
our dealings with the savage races of South Africa
we may forecast with some misgivings the probable
course of our connection with a country like New
Guinea.</p>

<p>A colony of Europeans in proximity with barbarian
neighbours naturally desires before long an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
increase of territory at the expense of the latter.
The first sign of such a desire is the expedition of
missionaries into the country, who not only serve to
spy it out for the benefit of the colony, but invariably
weaken the native political force by the creation of a
division of feeling, and of an opposition between the
love of old traditions and the temptation of novel
customs and ideas. The innovating party, being at
first the smaller, consisting of the feeblest and poorest
members of the community, and of those who gladly
flock to the mission-stations for refuge from their
offences against tribal law, the missionaries soon perceive
the impossibility of further success without the
help of some external aid. The help of a friendly
force can alone turn the balance of influence in their
favour, and they soon learn to contemplate with complacency
the advantages of a military conquest of the
natives by the colony or mother-country. The evils
of war are cancelled, in their eyes, by the delusive
visions of ultimate benefit, and, in accordance with a
not uncommon perversion of the moral sense, an end
that is assumed to be religious is made to justify
measures that are the reverse.</p>

<p>When the views and interests of the colonial
settlers and of the missionaries have thus, inevitably
but without design, fallen into harmony, a war is
certain to be not far distant. Apparently accidental,
it is in reality as certain as the production of green
from a mixture of blue and yellow. Some dispute
about boundaries, some passing act of violence, will
serve for a reason of quarrel, which will presently
be supported by a fixed array of collateral pretexts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
The Press readily lends its aid; and in a week the
colony trembles or affects to tremble from a panic
of invasion, and vials of virtue are expended on the
vices of the barbarians which have been for years
tolerated with equanimity or indifference. Their customs
are painted in the blackest colours; the details
of savage usages are raked up from old books of
travel; rumours of massacres and injuries are sedulously
propagated; and the whole country is represented
as in such a state of anarchy, that the majority
of the population, in their longing for deliverance
from their own rulers, would gladly welcome even a
foreign conqueror. In short, a war against them
comes speedily to be regarded as a war in their behalf,
as the last word of philanthropy and beneficence;
and the atrocities that subsequently ensue are professedly
undertaken, not against the unfortunate people
who endure them, but to liberate them from the ruler
of their choice or sufferance, in whose behalf however
they fight to the death.</p>

<p>To every country, therefore, which would fain be
spared from these discreditable wars with barbarian
tribes on the borders of its colonies, it is clear that
the greatest caution is necessary against the abuses
of missionary propagandism. The almost absolute
failure of missions in recent centuries, and more especially
in the nineteenth, is intimately associated with
the greater political importance which the improved
facilities of travel and intercourse have conferred upon
them. Everyone has heard how Catholicism was
persecuted in Japan, till at last the very profession of
Christianity was made a capital crime in that part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the world. But a traveller, who knew the East intimately
at the time, explains how it was that the
Jesuits’ labours resulted so disastrously. On the outbreak
of civil dissensions in Japan, ‘the Christian
priests thought it a proper time for them to settle
their religion on the same foundation that Mahomet
did his, by establishing it in blood. Their thoughts
ran on nothing less than extirpating the heathen out
of the land, and they framed a conspiracy of raising
an army of 50,000 Christians to murder their countrymen,
that so the whole island might be illuminated
by Christianity such as it was then.’<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> And in the
same way, a modern writer, speaking of the very
limited success of missions in India, has asserted
frankly that ‘in despair many Christians in India are
driven to wish and pray that some one, or some
way, may arise for converting the Indians by the
sword.’<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Nor are the heathen themselves blind to the political
dangers which are involved in the presence of missionaries
among them. All over the world conversion
is from the native point of view the same thing as
disaffection, and war is dreaded as the certain consequence
of the adoption of Christianity. The French
bishop, Lefebvre, when asked by the mandarins of
Cochin China, in 1847, the purpose of his visit, said
that he read in their faces that they suspected him
‘of having come to excite some outbreak among
the neophytes, and perhaps prepare the way for an
European army;’ and the king was ‘afraid to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Christians multiply in his kingdom, and in case of
war with European Powers, combine with his enemies.’<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
How right events have proved him to have
been!</p>

<p>The story is the same in Africa. ‘Not long after
I entered the country,’ said the missionary, Mr. Calderwood,
of Caffraria, ‘a leading chief once said to me,
“When my people become Christians, they cease to be
my people.”’<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The Norwegian missionaries were for
twenty years in Zululand without making any converts
but a few destitute children, many of whom had been
given to them out of pity by the chiefs,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and their
failure was actually ascribed by the Zulu king to their
having taught the incompatibility of Christianity with
allegiance to a heathen ruler.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> In 1877, a Zulu of
authority expressed the prevalent native reasoning on
this point in language which supplies the key to disappointments
that extend much further than Zululand:
‘We will not allow the Zulus to become so-called
Christians. It is not the king says so, but every man
in Zululand. If a Zulu does anything wrong, he at
once goes to a mission-station, and says he wants to
become a Christian; if he wants to run away with a
girl, he becomes a Christian; if he wishes to be
exempt from serving the king, he puts on clothes, and
is a Christian; if a man is an umtagati (evil-doer), he
becomes a Christian.’<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>It is on this account that in wars with savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
nations the destruction of mission-stations has always
been so constant an episode. Nor can we wonder at
this when we recollect that in the Caffre war of 1851,
for instance, it was a subject of boast with the missionaries
that it was Caffres trained on the mission-stations
who had preserved the English posts along
the frontiers, carried the English despatches, and
fought against their own countrymen for the preservation
and defence of the colony.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> It is rather a poor
result of all the money and labour that has been spent
in the attempt to Christianise South Africa, that the
Wesleyan mission-station at Edendale should have
contributed an efficient force of cavalry to fight against
their countrymen in the Zulu campaign; and we may
hesitate whether most to despise the missionaries who
count such a result as a triumph of their efforts, or
the converts whom they reward with tea and cake for
military service with the enemies of their countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>It needs no great strain of intelligence to perceive
that this use of mission-stations as military training-schools
scarcely tends to enhance the advantages of
conversion in the minds of the heathen among whom
they are planted.</p>

<p>For these reasons, and because it is becoming daily
more apparent that wars are less a necessary evil than
an optional misery of human life, the principal measure
for a country which would fain improve, and live at
peace with, the less civilised races which touch the
numerous borders of its empire, would be the legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
restraint or prevention of missionary enterprise: a
proposal that will appear less startling if we reflect that
in no quarter of the globe can that method of civilising
barbarism point to more than local or ephemeral
success. The Protestant missions of this century are
in process of failure, as fatal and decided as that which
befel the Catholic missions of the French, Portuguese,
or Spanish, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and very much from the same causes. The English
wars in South Africa, with which the Protestant
missionaries have been so closely connected, have
frustrated all attempts to Christianise that region, just
as ‘the fearful wars occasioned directly or indirectly
by the missionaries’ sent by the Portuguese to the
kingdoms of Congo and Angola in the sixteenth century
rendered futile similar attempts on the West
Coast.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>The same process of depopulation under Protestant
influences may now be observed in the Sandwich
Islands or New Zealand that reduced the population
of Hispaniola, under Spanish Christianity, from a
million to 14,000 in a quarter of a century.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> No
Protestant missionary ever laboured with more zeal
than Eliot did in America in the seventeenth century,
but the tribes he taught have long since been extinct:
‘like one of their own forest trees, they have withered
from core to bark;’<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and, in short, the history of both
Catholic and Protestant missions alike may be summed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
up in this one general statement: either they have
failed altogether of results on a sufficient scale to be
worthy of notice, or the impartial page of history
unfolds to us one uniform tale of civil war, persecution,
conquest, and extirpation in whatever regions they
can boast of more at least of the semblance of success.</p>

<p>Another measure in the interests of peace would
be the organisation of a class of well-paid officials
whose duty it should be to examine on the spot into
the truth of all rumours of outrages or atrocities
which are circulated from time to time, in order to set
the tide of public opinion in favour of hostile measures.
Such rumours may, of course, have some foundation,
but in nine cases out of ten they are false. So lately
as the year 1882, the <i>Times</i> and other English papers
were so far deceived as to give their readers a horrible
account of the sacrifice of 200 young girls to the
spirits of the dead in Ashantee; and people were
beginning to ask themselves whether such things
could be suffered within reach of an English army,
when it was happily discovered that the whole story
was fictitious. Stories of this sort are what the
Germans call <i>Tendenzlügen</i>, or lies invented to produce
a certain effect. Their effect in rousing the war-spirit
is undeniable; and, although the healthy scepticism
which has of recent years been born of experience
affords us some protection, no expenditure could be
more economical than one which should aim at rendering
them powerless by neutralising them at the
fountain-head.</p>

<p>In the preceding historical survey of the relations
in war between communities standing on different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
levels of civilisation, the allusion, among some of the
rudest tribes, to laws of war very similar to those
supposed to be binding between more polished nations
tends to discredit the distinction between civilised
and barbarian warfare. The progress of knowledge
threatens the overthrow of the distinction, just
as it has already reduced that between organic and
inorganic matter, or between animal and vegetable life,
to a distinction founded rather on human thought than
on the nature of things. And it is probable that the
more the military side of savage life is studied, the
fewer will be found to be the lines of demarcation
which are thought to establish a difference in kind in
the conduct of war by belligerents in different stages
of progress. The difference in this respect is chiefly
one of weapons, of strategy, and of tactics; and it
would seem that whatever superiority the more civilised
community may claim in its rules of war is more
than compensated in savage life both by the less
frequent occurrence of wars and by their far less fatal
character.</p>

<p>But, however much the frequency and ferocity of
the wars waged by barbarian races as compared with
those waged by civilised nations has been exaggerated,
there is no doubt but that in warfare, more than in
anything else, there is most in common between civilisation
and savagery, and that the distinction between
them most nearly disappears. In art and knowledge
and religion the distinction between the two is so
wide that the evolution of one from the other seems
still to many minds incredible; but in war, and the
thoughts which relate to it, the points of analogy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
cannot fail to strike the most indifferent. We see
still in either condition, the same notions of the glory
of fighting, the same belief in war as the only source
of strength and honour, the same hope from it of
personal advancement, the same readiness to seize
any pretext for resorting to it, the same foolish
sentiment that it is mean to live without it.</p>

<p>Then only will the distinction between the two be
final, complete, and real, when all fighting is relegated
to barbarism, and regarded as unworthy of civilised
humanity; when the enlightenment of opinion, which
has freed us already from such curses as slavery, the
torture-chamber, or duelling, shall demand instinctively
the settlement of all causes of quarrel by peaceful
arbitration, and leave to the lower races and the
lower creation the old-fashioned resort to a trial of
violence and might, to competition in fraud and
ferocity.</p>

<p>Whether military service was lawful for a Christian
at all was at the time of the Reformation one of the
most keenly debated questions; and considering the
force of opinion arrayed on the negative side, its
ultimate decision in the affirmative is a matter of
more wonder than is generally given to it. Sir
Thomas More charges Luther and his disciples with
carrying the doctrines of peace to the extreme limits
of non-resistance; and the views on this subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the Mennonites and Quakers were but what at one
time seemed not unlikely to have been those of the
Reformed Church generally.</p>

<p>By far the foremost champion on the negative
side was Erasmus, who being at Rome at the time
when the League of Cambray, under the auspices of
Julius II., was meditating war against the Republic of
Venice, wrote a book to the Pope, entitled ‘Antipolemus,’
which, though never completed, probably exists
in part in his tract known under the title of ‘Dulce
Bellum inexpertis,’ and printed among his ‘Adagia.’
In it he complained, as one might complain still, that
the custom of war was so recognised as an incident
of life that men wondered there should be any to
whom it was displeasing; and likewise so approved
of generally, that to find any fault with it savoured
not only of impiety, but of actual heresy. To speak
of it, therefore, as he did in the following passage,
required some courage: ‘If there be anything in the
affairs of mortals which it is the interest of men not
only to attack, but which ought by every possible
means to be avoided, condemned, and abolished, it is
of all things war, than which nothing is more impious,
more calamitous, more widely pernicious, more inveterate,
more base, or in sum more unworthy of a
man, not to say of a Christian.’ In a letter to
Francis I. on the same subject, he noticed as an
astonishing fact, that out of such a multitude of
abbots, bishops, archbishops, and cardinals as existed
in the world, not one of them should step forward to
do what he could, even at the risk of his life, to put
an end to so deplorable a practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>The failure of this view of the custom of war,
which is in its essence more opposed to Christianity
than the custom of selling men for slaves or sacrificing
them to idols, to take any root in men’s minds,
is a misfortune on which the whole history of Europe
since Erasmus forms a sufficient commentary. That
failure is partly due to the unlucky accident which led
Grotius in this matter to throw all his weight into the
opposite scale. For this famous jurist, entering at
much length into the question of the compatibility
of war with the profession of Christianity (thereby
proving the importance which in his day still attached
to it), came to conclusions in favour of the received
opinion, which are curiously characteristic both of the
writer and his time. His general argument was, that
if a sovereign was justified in putting his own subjects
to death for crimes, much more was he justified
in using the sword against people who were not his
subjects, but strangers to him. And this absurd
argument was enforced by considerations as feeble as
the following: that laws of war were laid down in
the Book of Deuteronomy; that John the Baptist did
not bid the soldiers, who consulted him, to forsake
their calling, but to abstain from extortion and be
content with their wages; that Cornelius the centurion,
whom St. Peter baptized, neither gave up his
military life, nor was exhorted by the apostle to do
so; that the Emperor Constantine had many Christians
in his armies, and the name of Christ inscribed
upon his banners; and that the military oath after
his time was taken in the name of the Three Persons
of the Trinity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>One single reflection will suffice to display the
utter shallowness of this reasoning, which was after
all only borrowed from St. Augustine. For if Biblical
texts are a justification of war, they are clearly a
justification of slavery; whilst, on the other hand, the
general spirit of the Christian religion, to say nothing
of several positive passages, is at least equally opposed
to one custom as to the other. If then the
abolition of slavery is one of the services for which
Christianity as an influence in history claims a large
share of the credit, its failure to abolish the other
custom must in fairness be set against it; for it were
easier to defend slave-holding out of the language of
the New Testament than to defend military service,
far more being actually said there to inculcate the
duty of peace than to inculcate the principles of
social equality: and the same may be said of the
writings of the Fathers.</p>

<p>The different attitude of the Church towards these
two customs in modern times, her vehement condemnation
of the one, and her tolerance or encouragement
of the other, appears all the more surprising
when we remember that in the early centuries of our
era her attitude was exactly the reverse, and that,
whilst slavery was permitted, the unlawfulness of war
was denounced with no uncertain or wavering voice.</p>

<p>When Tertullian wrote his treatise ‘De Corona’
(201) concerning the right of Christian soldiers to
wear laurel crowns, he used words on this subject
which, even if at variance with some of his statements
made in his ‘Apology’ thirty years earlier, may be
taken to express his maturer judgment. ‘Shall the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
son of peace’ (that is, a Christian), he asks, ‘act in
battle when it will not befit him even to go to
law? Shall he administer bonds and imprisonments
and tortures and punishments who may not avenge
even his own injuries?... The very transference of
his enrolment from the army of light to that of
darkness is sin.’ And again: ‘What if the soldiers
did go to John and receive the rule of their service,
and what if the Centurion did believe; the Lord by
his disarming of Peter disarmed every soldier from
that time forward.’ Tertullian made an exception in
favour of soldiers whose conversion was subsequent
to their enrolment (as was implied in discussing their
duty with regard to the laurel-wreath), though insisting
even in their case that they ought either to
leave the service, as many did, or to refuse participation
in its acts, which were inconsistent with their
Christian profession. So that at that time Christian
opinion was clearly not only averse to a military life
being entered upon after baptism (of which there are
no instances on record), but in favour of its being
forsaken, if the enrolment preceded the baptism.
The Christians who served in the armies of Rome
were not men who were converts or Christians at the
time of enrolling, but men who remained with the
colours after their conversion. If it is certain that
some Christians <i>remained</i> in the army, it appears
equally certain that no Christian at that time thought
of <i>entering</i> it.</p>

<p>This seems the best solution of the much-debated
question, to what extent Christians served at all in the
early centuries. Irenæus speaks of the Christians in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the second century as not knowing how to fight, and
Justin Martyr, his contemporary, considered Isaiah’s
prophecy about the swords being turned into ploughshares
as in part fulfilled, because his co-religionists,
who in times past had killed one another, did not
then know how to fight even with their enemies. The
charge made by Celsus against the Christians, that
they refused to bear arms even in case of necessity,
was admitted by Origen, but justified on the ground
of the unlawfulness of war. ‘We indeed,’ he says,
‘fight in a special way on the king’s behalf, but we
do not go on campaigns with him, even should he
press us to do so; we do battle on his behalf as
a peculiar army of piety, prevailing by our prayers to
God for him.’ And again: ‘We no longer take up
the sword against people, nor learn to make war
any more, having become through Jesus, who is our
general, sons of peace.’ Nothing could be clearer
nor more conclusive than this language; and the
same attitude towards war was expressed or implied
by the following Fathers in chronological order:
Justin Martyr, Tatian, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian,
Cyprian, Lactantius, Archelaus, Ambrose,
Chrysostom, Jerome, and Cyril. Eusebius says that
many Christians in the third century laid aside the
military life rather than abjure their religion. Of
10,050 pagan inscriptions that have been collected,
545 were found to belong to pagan soldiers, while of
4,734 Christian inscriptions of the same period, only
27 were those of soldiers; from which it seems rather
absurd to infer, as a French writer has inferred, not
that there was a great disproportion of Christian to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
pagan soldiers in the imperial armies, but that most
Christian soldiers being soldiers of Christ did not like
to have it recorded on their epitaphs that they had
been in the service of any <i>man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, there were certainly always
some Christians who remained in the ranks after
their conversion, in spite of the military oath in the
names of the pagan deities and the quasi-worship of
the standards which constituted some part of the
early Christian antipathy to war. This is implied in
the remarks of Tertullian, and stands in no need of
the support of such legends as the Thundering Legion
of Christians, whose prayers obtained rain, or of the
Theban legion of 6,000 Christians martyred under
Maximian. It was left as a matter of individual
conscience. In the story of the martyr Maximilian,
when Dion the proconsul reminded him that there
were Christian soldiers among the life-guards of the
Emperors, the former replied, ‘They know what is
best for them to do; but I am a Christian and cannot
fight.’ Marcellus, the converted centurion, threw
down his belt at the head of his legion, and suffered
death rather than continue in the service; and the
annals of the early Church abound in similar martyrdoms.
Nor can there be much doubt but that a love
of peace and dislike of bloodshed were the principal
causes of this early Christian attitude towards the
military profession, and that the idolatry and other
pagan rites connected with it only acted as minor and
secondary deterrents. Thus, in the Greek Church
St. Basil would have excluded from communion for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
three years any one who had shed an enemy’s blood;
and a similar feeling explains Theodosius’ refusal to
partake of the Eucharist after his great victory over
Eugenius. The canons of the Church excluded from
ordination all who had served in an army after
baptism; and in the fifth century Innocent I. blamed
the Spanish churches for their laxity in admitting
such persons into holy orders.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>The anti-military tendency of opinion in the early
period of Christianity appears therefore indisputable,
and Tertullian would probably have smiled at the
prophet who should have predicted that Christians
would have ceased to keep slaves long before they
should have ceased to commit murder and robbery
under the fiction of hostilities. But it proves the
strength of the original impetus, that Ulphilas, the
first apostle to the Goths, should purposely, in his
translation of the Scriptures, have omitted the Books
of Kings, as too stimulative of a love of war.</p>

<p>How utterly in this matter Christianity came to
forsake its earlier ideal is known to all. This resulted
partly from the frequent use of the sword for the
purpose of conversion, and partly from the rise of the
Mahometan power, which made wars with the infidel
appear in the light of acts of faith, and changed the
whole of Christendom into a kind of vast standing
military order. But it resulted still more from that
compromise effected in the fourth century between
paganism and the new religion, in which the former
retained more than it lost, and the latter gave less
than it received. Considering that the Druid priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of ancient Gaul or Britain, like those of pagan Rome,
were exempt from military service,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and often, according
to Strabo, had such influence as to part combatants
on the point of an engagement, nothing is more remarkable
than the extent to which the Christian
clergy, bishops, and abbots came to lead armies and
fight in battle, in spite of canons and councils of the
Church, at a time when that Church’s power was
greater, and its influence wider, than it has ever been
since. Historians have scarcely given due prominence
to this fact, which covers a period of at least a thousand
years; for Gregory of Tours mentions two
bishops of the sixth century who had killed many
enemies with their own hands, whilst Erasmus, in the
sixteenth, complains of bishops taking more pride in
leading three or four hundred dragoons, with swords
and guns, than in a following of deacons and divinity
students, and asks, with just sarcasm, why the trumpet
and fife should sound sweeter in their ears than the
singing of psalms or the words of the Bible.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century, when war and chivalry
were at their height, occurred a remarkable protest
against this state of things from Wycliffe, who, in
this, as in other respects, anticipated the Reformation:
‘Friars now say that bishops can fight best of all
men, and that it falleth most properly to them, since
they are lords of all this world. They say, Christ
bade his disciples sell their coats, and buy them
swords; but whereto, if not to fight? Thus friars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
make a great array, and stir up men to fight. But
Christ taught not his apostles to fight with a sword of
iron, but with the sword of God’s word, which standeth
in meekness of heart and in the prudence of man’s
tongue.... If manslaying in others be odious to
God, much more in priests who should be vicars
of Christ.’ And Wycliffe proceeds not only to protest
against this, but to advocate the general cause of
peace on earth, on grounds which he is aware that
men of the world will scorn and reject as fatal to the
existence of kingdoms.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>It was no occasional, but an inveterate practice,
and, apparently, common in the world, long before
the system of feudalism gave it some justification by
the connection of military service with the enjoyment
of lands. Yet it has now so completely disappeared
that&mdash;as a proof of the possible change of thought
which may ultimately render a Christian soldier as
great an anomaly as a fighting bishop&mdash;it is worth
recalling from history some instances of so curious
a custom. ‘The bishops themselves&mdash;not all, but
many’&mdash;says a writer of King Stephen’s reign,
‘bound in iron, and completely furnished with arms,
were accustomed to mount war-horses with the perverters
of their country, to share in their spoil; to
bind and torture the knights whom they took in the
chance of war, or whom they met full of money.’<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
It was at the battle of Bouvines (1214) that the
famous Bishop of Beauvais fought with a club instead
of a sword, out of respect for the rule of the canon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
which forbade an ecclesiastic to shed blood. Matthew
Paris tells the story how Richard I. took the said
bishop prisoner, and when the Pope begged for his
release as being his own son and a son of the Church,
sent to Innocent III. the episcopal coat of mail, with
the inquiry whether he recognised it as that of his son
or of a son of the Church; to which the Pope had the
wit to reply that he could not recognise it as belonging
to either.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The story also bears repeating of the
impatient knight who, sharing the command of a
division at the battle of Falkirk with the Bishop of
Durham, cried out to his slower colleague, before
closing with the Scots, ‘It is not for you to teach us
war; to your Mass, bishop!’ and therewith rushed
with his followers into the fray (1298).<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, needless to multiply instances,
which, if Du Cange may be credited, became more common
during the devastation of France by the Danes
in the ninth century, when all the military aid that
was available became a matter of national existence.
That event rendered Charlemagne’s capitulary a dead
letter, by which that monarch had forbidden any
ecclesiastic to march against an enemy, save two or
three bishops to bless the army or reconcile the
combatants, and a few priests to give absolution and
celebrate the Mass.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> It appears that this law was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
made in response to an exhortation by Pope Adrian II.,
similar to one addressed in the previous century by
Pope Zachary to Charlemagne’s ancestor, King Pepin.
But though military service and the tenure of ecclesiastical
benefices became more common from the time
of the Danish irruptions, instances are recorded of
abbots and archbishops who chose rather to surrender
their temporalities than to take part in active service;
and for many centuries the whole question seems to
have rested on a most uncertain footing, law and
custom demanding as a duty that which public and
ecclesiastical opinion condoned, but which the Church
herself condemned.</p>

<p>It is a signal mark of the degree to which religion
became enveloped in the military spirit of those miserable
days of chivalry, that ecclesiastical preferment
was sometimes the reward of bravery on the field, as
in the case of that chaplain to the Earl of Douglas
who, for his courage displayed at the battle of Otterbourne,
was, Froissart tells us, promoted the same
year to a canonry and archdeaconry at Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Vasari, in his ‘Life of Michael Angelo,’ has a good
story which is not only highly typical of this martial
Christianity, but may be also taken to mark the
furthest point of divergence reached by the Church
in this respect from the standpoint of her earlier
teaching. Pope Julius II. went one day to see a
statue of himself which Michael Angelo was executing.
The right hand of the statue was raised in a dignified
attitude, and the artist consulted the Pope as to
whether he should place a book in the left. ‘Put a
sword into it,’ quoth Julius, ‘for of letters I know but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
little.’ This was the Pope of whom Bayle says that
never man had a more warlike soul, and of whom,
with some doubt, he repeats the anecdote of his
having thrown into the Tiber the keys of St. Peter,
with the declaration that he would thenceforth use
the sword of St. Paul. However this may be, he
went in person to hasten the siege of Mirandola, in
opposition to the protests of the cardinals and to the
scandal of Christendom (1510). There it was that
to encourage the soldiers he promised them, that if
they exerted themselves valiantly he would make no
terms with the town, but would suffer them to sack
it;<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and though this did not occur, and the town ultimately
surrendered on terms, the head of the Christian
Church had himself conveyed into it by the breach.</p>

<p>The scandal of this proceeding contributed its
share to the discontent which produced the Reformation;
and that movement continued still further the
disfavour with which many already viewed the connection
of the clergy with actual warfare. It has,
however, happened occasionally since that epoch that
priests of martial tastes have been enabled to gratify
them, the custom having become more and more rare
as public opinion grew stronger against it. The last
recorded instance of a fighting divine was, it would
seem, the Bishop of Derry, who, having been raised to
that see by William III. in gratitude for the distinguished
bravery with which, though a clergyman, he
had conducted the defence of Londonderry against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
forces of James II., and for which the University of
Oxford rewarded him with the title of Doctor of
Divinity, was shot dead at the battle of the Boyne.
He had, says Macaulay, ‘during the siege in which he
had so highly distinguished himself, contracted a passion
for war,’ but his zeal to gratify it on that second
occasion cost him the favour of the king. It is, however,
somewhat remarkable that history should have
called no special attention to the last instance of a
bishop who fought and died upon a battle-field, nor have
sufficiently emphasised the great revolution of thought
which first changed a common occurrence into something
unusual, and finally into a memory that seems
ridiculous. No historical fact affords a greater justification
than this for the hope that, absurd as is the idea
of a fighting bishop to our own age, that of a fighting
Christian may be to our posterity.</p>

<p>As bishops were in the middle ages warriors, so
they were also the common bearers of declarations of
war. The Bishop of Lincoln bore, for instance, the
challenge of Edward III. and his allies to Charles V.
at Paris; and greatly offended was the English king
and his council when Charles returned the challenge
by a common valet&mdash;they declared it indecent for a
war between two such great lords to be declared by a
mere servant, and not by a prelate or a knight of valour.</p>

<p>The declaration of war in those times appears to
have meant simply a challenge or defiance like that
then and afterwards customary in a duel. It appears to
have originated out of habits that governed the relations
between the feudal barons. We learn from Froissart
that when Edward was made Vicar of the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Empire an old statute was renewed which had before
been made at the emperor’s court, to the effect that
no one, intending to injure his neighbour, might do
so without sending him a defiance three days beforehand.
The following extract from the challenge of
war sent by the Duke of Orleans, the brother of the
King of France, to Henry IV. of England, testifies to
the close resemblance between a declaration of war
and a challenge to a deed of arms, and to the levity
which often gave rise to either: ‘I, Louis, write and
make known to you, that with the aid of God and
the blessed Trinity, in the desire which I have to gain
renown, and which you likewise should feel, considering
idleness as the bane of lords of high birth who do not
employ themselves in arms, and thinking I can no
way better seek renown than by proposing to you to
meet me at an appointed place, each of us accompanied
with 100 knights and esquires, of name and
arms without reproach, there to combat till one of the
parties shall surrender; and he to whom God shall grant
the victory shall do with his prisoners as he pleases.
We will not employ any incantations that are forbidden
by the Church, but make use of the bodily strength
given us by God, with armour as may be most agreeable
to everyone for the security of his person,
and with the usual arms, that is lance, battle-axe,
sword, and dagger ... without aiding himself by any
bodkins, hooks, bearded darts, poisoned needles or
razors, as may be done by persons unless they are
positively ordered to the contrary....’<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Henry IV.
answered the challenge with some contempt, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
expressed his readiness to meet the duke in single
combat, whenever he should visit his possessions in
France, in order to prevent any greater effusion of
Christian blood, since a good shepherd, he said, should
expose his own life for his flock. It even seemed at one
time as if wars might have resolved themselves into
this more rational mode of settlement. The Emperor
Henry IV. challenged the Duke of Swabia to single
combat. Philip Augustus of France is said to have
proposed to Richard I. to settle their differences by a
combat of five on each side; and when Edward III.
challenged the realm of France, he offered to settle
the question by a duel or a combat of 100 men on
each side, with which the French king would, it appears,
have complied, had Edward consented to stake the
kingdom of England against that of France.</p>

<p>In the custom of naming the implements of war
after the most revered names of the Christian hagiology
may be observed another trace of the close alliance
that resulted between the military and spiritual sides
of human life, somewhat like that which prevailed in
the sort of worship paid to their lances, pikes, and
battle-axes by the ancient Scandinavians.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Thus the
two first forts which the Spaniards built in the Ladrone
Islands they called respectively after St. Francis
Xavier and the Virgin Mary. Twelve ships in the
Armada were called after the Twelve Apostles, and
so were twelve of his cannons by Henry VIII., one
of which, St. John by name, was captured by the
French in 1513.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> It is probable that mere irreverence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
had less to do with this custom than the hope thereby
of obtaining favour in war, such as may also be
traced in the ceremony of consecrating military banners,
which has descended to our own times.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>To the same order of superstition belongs the old
custom of falling down and kissing the earth before
starting on a charge or assault of battle. The practice
is alluded to several times in Montluc’s Commentaries,
but so little was it understood by a modern
French editor that in one place he suggests the reading
<i>baissèrent la tête</i> (they lowered their heads) for <i>baisèrent
la terre</i> (they kissed the earth). But the latter
reading is confirmed by passages elsewhere; as, for
instance, in the ‘Memoirs of Fleurange,’ where it is
stated that Gaston de Foix and his soldiers kissed
the earth, according to custom, before proceeding to
march against the enemy;<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and, again, in the ‘Life
of Bayard,’ by his secretary, who records it among
the virtues of that knight that he would rise from his
bed every night to prostrate himself at full length on
the floor and kiss the earth.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> This kissing of the
earth was an abbreviated form of taking a particle of
it in the mouth, as both Elmham and Livius mention
to have been done by the English at Agincourt before
attacking the French; and this again was an
abbreviated form of receiving the sacrament, for
Villani says of the Flemish at Cambray (1302) that
they made a priest go all over the field with the
sacred elements, and that, instead of communicating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
each man took a little earth and put it into his
mouth.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> This seems a more likely explanation than
that the custom was intended as a reminder to the
soldier of his mortality, as if in a trade like his there
could be any lack of testimony of that sort.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe how war in every stage of
civilisation has been the central interest of public
religious supplication; and how, from the pagans of
old to modern savages, the pettiest quarrels and conflicts
have been deemed a matter of interest to the
immortals. The Sandwich islanders and Tahitians
sought the aid of their gods in war by human sacrifices.
The Fijians before war were wont to present
their gods with costly offerings and temples, and offer
with their prayers the best they could of land crabs
or whales’ teeth; being so convinced that they thereby
ensured to themselves the victory, that once, when
a missionary called the attention of a war party to the
scantiness of their numbers, they only replied, with
disdainful confidence, ‘Our allies are the gods.’ The
prayer which the Roman pontifex addressed to Jupiter
on behalf of the Republic at the opening of the war
with Antiochus, king of Syria, is extremely curious:
‘If the war which the people has ordered to be waged
with King Antiochus shall be finished after the wish of
the Roman senate and people, then to thee, O Jupiter,
will the Roman people exhibit the great games for
ten successive days, and offerings shall be presented
at all the shrines of such value as the senate shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
decree.’<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> This rude state of theology, wherein a
victory from the gods may be obtained for a fair consideration
in exchange, tends to keep alive, if it did
not originate, that sense of dependence on invisible
powers which constitutes the most rudimentary form of
religion; for it is a remarkable fact that the faintest
notions of supernatural agencies are found precisely
among tribes whose military organisation or love for
war is the lowest and least developed. In proportion
as the war-spirit is cultivated does the worship of war-presiding
deities prevail; and since these are formed
from the memories of warriors who have died or
been slain, their attributes and wishes remain those of
the former earthly potentate, who though no longer
visible, may still be gratified by presents of fruit, or by
slaughtered oxen or slaves.</p>

<p>The Khonds of Orissa, in India, afford an instance
of this close and pernicious association between religious
and military ideas, which may be traced
through the history of many far more advanced communities.
For though they regard the joy of the
peace dance as the very highest attainable upon earth,
they attribute, not to their own will, but to that of
their war god, Loha Pennu, the source of all their
wars. The devastation of a fever or tiger is accepted
as a hint from that divinity that his service has been
too long neglected, and they acquit themselves of all
blame for a war begun for no better reason, by the
following philosophy of its origin: ‘Loha Pennu said
to himself, Let there be war, and he forthwith entered
into all weapons, so that from instruments of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
they became weapons of war; he gave edge to the
axe and point to the arrow; he entered into all kinds
of food and drink, so that men in eating and drinking
were filled with rage, and women became instruments
of discord instead of soothers of anger.’ And they
address this prayer to Loha Pennu for aid against
their enemies: ‘Let our axes crush cloth and bones
as the jaws of the hyæna crush its prey. Make the
wounds we give to gape.... When the wounds of
our enemies heal, let lameness remain. Let their
stones and arrows fall on us as the flowers of the
mowa-tree fall in the wind.... Make their weapons
brittle as the long pods of the karta-tree.’</p>

<p>In their belief that wars were of external causation
to themselves, and in their endeavour to win by
prayer a favourable issue to their appeal to arms, it
could scarcely be maintained that the nations of
Christendom have at all times shown any marked
superiority over the modern Khonds. But in spite of
this, and of the fierce military character that Christianity
ultimately assumed, the Church always kept
alive some of her earlier traditions about peace, and
even in the darkest ages set some barriers to the
common fury of the soldier. When the Roman
Empire was overthrown, her influence in this direction
was in marked contrast with what it has been ever
since. Even Alaric when he sacked Rome (410) was
so far affected by Christianity as to spare the churches
and the Christians who fled to them. Leo the Great,
Bishop of Rome, inspired even Attila with respect for
his priestly authority, and averted his career of conquest
from Rome; and the same bishop, three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
later (455), pleaded with the victorious Genseric that
his Vandals should spare the unresisting multitude
and the buildings of Rome, nor allow torture to be
inflicted on their prisoners. At the instance of Gregory
II., Luitprand, the Lombard king, withdrew
his troops from the same city, resigned his conquests,
and offered his sword and dagger on the tomb of St.
Peter (730).</p>

<p>Yet more praiseworthy and perhaps more effective
were the efforts of the Church from the tenth century
onwards to check that system of private war which
was then the bane of Europe, as the system of public
and international wars has been since. In the south
of France several bishops met and agreed to exclude
from the privileges of a Christian in life and after
death all who violated their ordinances directed
against that custom (990). Only four years later the
Council of Limoges exhorted men to swear by the
bodies of the saints that they would cease to violate
the public peace. Lent appears to have been to some
extent a season of abstinence from fighting as from
other pleasures, for one of the charges against Louis
le Débonnaire was that he summoned an expedition
for that time of the year.</p>

<p>In 1032 a Bishop of Aquitaine declared himself
the recipient of a message from heaven, ordering men
to cease from fighting; and, not only did a peace,
called the Truce of God, result for seven years, but it
was resolved that such peace should always prevail
during the great festivals of the Church, and from
every Thursday evening to Monday morning. And
the regulation for one kingdom was speedily extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
over Christendom, confirmed by several Popes, and
enforced by excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> If such efforts were
not altogether successful, and the wars of the barons
continued till the royal power in every country was
strong enough to suppress them, it must none the
less be recognised that the Church fought, if she
fought in vain, against the barbarism of a military
society, and with an ardour that is in striking contrast
with her apathy in more recent history.</p>

<p>It must also be granted that the idea of what the
Papacy might do for the peace of the world, as the
supreme arbiter of disputes and mediator between
contending Powers, gained possession of men’s minds,
and entered into the definite policy of the Church
about the twelfth century, in a manner that might
suggest reflection for the nineteenth. The name of
Gerohus de Reigersperg is connected with a plan for
the pacification of the world, by which the Pope was
to forbid war to all Christian princes, to settle all
disputes between them, and to enforce his decisions
by the greatest powers that have ever yet been devised
for human authority&mdash;namely, by excommunication
and deposition. And the Popes attempted something
of this sort. When, for instance, Innocent III. bade
the King of France to make peace with Richard I.,
and was told that the dispute concerned a matter of
feudal relationship with which the Pope had no right
of interference, he replied that he interfered by right
of his power to censure what he thought sin, and
quite irrespective of feudal rights. He also refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
consider the destruction of places and the slaughter
of Christians as a matter of no concern to him; and
Honorius III. forbade an attack upon Denmark, on
the ground that that kingdom lay under the special
protection of the Papacy.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>The clergy, moreover, were even in the most warlike
times of history the chief agents in negotiations
for peace, and in the attempt to set limits to military
reprisals. When, for instance, the French and English
were about to engage at Poitiers, the Cardinal of
Perigord spent the whole of the Sunday that preceded
the day of battle in laudable but ineffectual attempts
to bring the two sides to an agreement without a
battle. And when the Duke of Anjou was about to
put 600 of the defenders of Montpellier to death by
the sword, by the halter, and by fire, it was the Cardinal
of Albany and a Dominican monk who saved
him from the infamy of such a deed by reminding him
of the duty of Christian forgiveness.</p>

<p>In these respects it must be plain to every one that
the attitude and power of the Church has entirely
changed. She has stood apart more and more as time
has gone on from her great opportunities as a promoter
of peace. Her influence, it is notorious, no longer
counts for anything, where it was once so powerful, in
the field of negotiation and reconcilement. She lifts
no voice to denounce the evils of war, nor to plead for
greater restraint in the exercise of reprisals and the
abuse of victory. She lends no aid to teach the duty
of forbearance and friendship between nations, to
diminish their idle jealousies, nor to explain the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
identity of their interests. It may even be said
without risk of contradiction, that whatever attempt
has been made to further the cause of peace upon earth
or to diminish the horror of the customs of war, has
come, not from the Church, but from the school of
thought to which she has been most opposed, and
which she has studied most persistently to revile.</p>

<p>In respect, too, of the justice of the cause of war,
the Church within recent centuries has entirely vacated
her position. It is noticeable that in the 37th article
of the English Church, which is to the effect that a
Christian at the command of the magistrate may wear
weapons and serve in the wars, the word <i>justa</i>, which
in the Latin form preceded the word <i>bella</i> or wars, has
been omitted.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The leaders of the Reformation decided
on the whole in favour of the lawfulness of military
service for a Christian, but with the distinct
reservation that the cause of war should be just.
Bullinger, who was Zwingli’s successor in the Reformed
Church at Zurich, decided that though a Christian
might take up arms at the command of the magistrate,
it would be his duty to disobey the magistrate if he
purposed to make war on the guiltless; and that only
the death of those soldiers on the battle-field was
glorious who fought for their religion or their country.
Thomas Becon, chaplain to Archbishop Cranmer,
complained of the utter disregard of a just and patriotic
motive for war in the code of military ethics then
prevalent. Speaking of the fighters of his day, he thus
characterised their position in the State: ‘The rapacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
of wolves, the violence of lions, the fierceness of tigers
is nothing in comparison of their furious and cruel
tyranny; and yet do many of them this not for the
safeguard of their country (for so it would be the more
tolerable), but to satisfy their butcher-like affects, to
boast another day of how many men they have been
the death, and to bring home the more preys that they
may live the fatter ever after for these spoils and stolen
goods.’<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> From military service he maintained that all
considerations of justice and humanity had been entirely
banished, and their stead been taken by robbery
and theft, ‘the insatiable spoiling of other men’s goods,
and a whole sea of barbarous and beast-like manners.’
In this way the necessity of a just cause as a reason
for taking part in actual warfare was reasserted at the
time of the Reformation, and has only since then been
allowed to drop out of sight altogether; so that now
public opinion has no guide in the matter, and even less
than it had in ancient Rome, the attitude of the Church
towards the State on this point being rather that of
Anaxarchus the philosopher to Alexander the Great,
when, to console that conqueror for his murder of Clitus,
he said to him: ‘Know you not that Jupiter is represented
with Law and Justice at his side, to show that
whatever is done by sovereign power is right?’</p>

<p>Considering, therefore, that no human institution
yet devised or actually in existence has had or has a
moral influence or facilities for exercising it at all
equal to that enjoyed by the Church, it is all the
more to be regretted that she has never taken any
real interest in the abolition of a custom which is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the root of half the crime and misery with which she
has to contend. Whatever hopes might at one time
have been reasonably entertained of the Reformed
Church as an anti-military agency, the cause of peace
soon sank into a sort of heresy, or what was worse, an
unfashionable tenet, associated, condemned, and contemned
with other articles of religious dissent. ‘Those
who condemn the profession or art of soldiery,’ said
Sir James Turner, ‘smell rank of anabaptism and
quakery.’<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>It would be difficult to find in the whole range of
history any such example of wasted moral force. As
Erasmus had cause to deplore it in the sixteenth
century, so had Voltaire in the eighteenth. The
latter complained that he did not remember a single
page against war in the whole of Bourdaloue’s sermons,
and he even suggested that the real explanation
might be a literal want of courage on the part of the
clergy. The passage is worth quoting from the original,
both for its characteristic energy of expression and for
its clear insight into the real character of the custom
of war:&mdash;‘Pour les autres moralistes à gages que l’on
nomme prédicateurs, ils n’ont jamais seulement osé
prêcher contre la guerre.... Ils se gardent bien de
décrier la guerre, qui réunit tout ce que la perfidie a
de plus lâche dans les manifestes, tout ce que l’infâme
friponnerie a de plus bas dans les fournitures des
armées, tout ce que le brigandage a d’affreux dans le
pillage, le viol, le larcin, l’homicide, la dévastation, la
destruction. Au contraire, ces bons prêtres bénissent
en cérémonie les étendards de meurtre; et leurs con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>frères
chantent pour de l’argent des chansons juives,
quand la terre a été inondée de sang.’<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>If Voltaire’s reproach is unjust, it can of course be
easily refuted. The challenge is a fair one. Let him
be convicted of overstating his charge, by the mention
of any ecclesiastic of mark from either the Catholic or
the Protestant school within the last two centuries
whose name is associated with the advocacy of the
mitigation or the abolition of contests of force; or
any war in the same period which the clergy of either
denomination have as a body resisted either on the
ground of the injustice of its origin or of the ruthless
cruelty with which it has been waged. Whatever has
yet been attempted in this direction, or whatever
anti-military stimulus has been given to civilisation,
has come distinctly from men of the world or men of
letters, not from men of distinction in the Church:
not from Fénelon or Paley, but from William Penn,
the Abbé St.-Pierre (whose connection with the
Church was only nominal), from Vattel, Voltaire, and
Kant. In other words, the Church has lost her old
position of spiritual ascendency over the consciences
of mankind, and has surrendered to other guides and
teachers the influence she once exercised over the
world.</p>

<p>This is especially the case with our own Church;
for before the most gigantic evil of our time, her
pulpit stands mute, and colder than mute. Whatever
sanction or support a body like the Peace Society has
met with from the Church or churches of England
during its seventy years’ struggle on behalf of humanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
has been, not the general rule, but the rare exception;
and recent events would even seem to show that the
voice of the pulpit, so far from ever becoming a
pacific agency, is destined to become in the future the
great tocsin of war, the loudest clamourer for counsels
of aggression.</p>

<p>This attitude on the part of the Church having
become more and more marked and conspicuous, as
wars in recent centuries have become more frequent
and more fierce, it was not unnatural that some attempt
should at last have been made to give some
sort of justification of a fact which has undoubtedly
become an increasing source of perplexity and distress
to all sincere and reflective Christians. In
default of a better, let us take the justification offered
by Canon Mozley in his sermon on ‘War,’ preached
before the University of Oxford on March 12, 1871,
of which the following summary conveys a faithful,
though of necessity an abbreviated, reflection. The
main points dwelt upon in that explanation or
apology are: That Christianity, by its original recognition
of the division of the world into nations, with
all their inherent rights, thereby recognised the right
of war, which was plainly one of them; that the
Church, never having been constituted a judge of
national questions or motives, can only stand neutral
between opposing sides, contemplating war as it were
forensically, as a mode of international settlement
that is amply justified by the want of any other; that
a natural justice is inherent not only in wars of self-defence,
but in wars for rectifying the political distribution
of the world’s races or nationalities, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
wars that aim at progress and improvement; that
the spirit of self-sacrifice inseparable from war confers
upon it a moral character that is in special harmony
with the Christian type; that as war is simply the
working out of a problem by force, there is no more
hatred between the individual combatants than there
is in the working out of an argument by reasoning,
‘the enmity is in the two wholes&mdash;the abstractions&mdash;the
individuals are at peace;’ that the impossibility
of a substitution of a universal empire for independent
nations, or of a court of arbitration, bars all
hope of the attainment of an era of peace through
the natural progress of society; that the absence of
any head to the nations of the world constitutes a
defect or want of plan in its system, which as it has
been given to it by nature cannot be remedied by
other means; that it is no part of the mission of
Christianity to reconstruct that system, or rather
want of system, of the world, from which war flows,
nor to provide another world for us to live in; but
that, nevertheless, Christianity only sanctions it
through the medium of natural society, and on the
hypothesis of a world at discord with itself.</p>

<p>One may well wonder that such a tissue of irrelevant
arguments could have been addressed by any
man in a spirit of seriousness to an assembly of his
fellows. Imagine such utterances being the last word
of Christianity! Surely a son of the Church were
more recognisable under the fighting Bishop of Beauvais’
coat of mail than under the disguise of such
language as this. Why should it be assumed, one
might ask, that the existence of distinct nations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
each enjoying the power, and therefore the right to
make war upon its neighbours, is incompatible with
the existence of an international morality which should
render the exercise of the war-right impossible, or
very difficult; or that the Church, had she tried, could
have contributed nothing to so desirable a result? It
is begging the question altogether to contend that a
state of things is impossible which has never been
attempted, when the very point at issue is whether,
had it been attempted, it might not by this time have
come to be realised. The right of the mediæval
barons and their vassals to wage private war together
belonged once as much to the system, or want of system,
of the world as the right of nations to attack one another
in our own or an earlier period of history; yet so far
was the Church, even in those days, from shrinking
from contact with so barbarous a custom as something
beyond her power or her mission, that she was herself
the main social instrument that brought it to an end.
The great efforts made by the Church to abolish the
custom of private war have already been mentioned:
a point which Canon Mozley, perhaps, did wisely to
ignore. Yet there is, surely, no sufficient reason why
the peace of the world should be an object of less
interest to the Church in these days than it was in
those; or why her influence should be less as one
chief element in the natural progress of society than
it was when she fought to release human society from
the depraving custom of the right of private war. It
is impossible to contend that, had the Church inculcated
the duties of the individual to other nations as
well as to his own, in the way to which human reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
would naturally respond, such a course would have
had no effect in solving the problem of enabling separate
nationalities to coexist in a state of peace as well
as of independence. It is at least the reverse of self-evident
that the promotion of feelings of international
fraternity, the discouragement of habits of international
jealousy, the exercise of acts of international
friendship, the teaching of the real identity of international
interests, in all of which the pulpit might
have lent, or might yet lend, an invaluable aid, would
have had, or would still have any detrimental effect
on the political system of distinct nationalities, or on
the motives and actions of a rational patriotism. It
is difficult to believe that the denunciations of a Church
whose religious teaching had power to restrain the
military fury of an Alaric or a Genseric would have
been altogether powerless over the conduct of those
German hordes whose military excesses in France, in
1870, have left a lasting blot on their martial triumph
and the character of their discipline; or that her
efforts on behalf of peace, which more than a thousand
years ago effectually reconciled the Angles and
Mercians, the Franks and Lombards, would be wasted
in helping to remove any standing causes of quarrel
that may still exist between France and Germany,
England and Russia, Italy and Austria.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, hopeful signs, in spite of Canon
Mozley’s apology of despair, that the priesthood of
Christendom may yet reawake to a sense of its
power and opportunities for removing from the world
an evil custom which lies at the root of almost every
other, and is the main cause and sustenance of crime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and pauperism and disease. It is possible that we
have already passed the worst period of indifference
in this respect, or that it may some day prove only to
have been connected with the animosities of rival
sects, ever ready to avail themselves of the chances
that war between different nations might severally
bring to their several petty interests. With the
subsidence of such animosities, it were reasonable to
expect the Church to reassert the more genuine
principle of her action and attitude&mdash;that no evil
incident to human society is to be regarded as irremediable
till every resource has been exhausted to
cope with it, and every outlet of escape from it been
proved to be a failure. Then, but not till then, is it
becoming in Christian priests to utter the language
of helplessness; then, but not till then, should the
Church fold her hands in despair.</p>

answerable for Socialism.</p>

<p>Two widely different conceptions of military discipline
are contained in the words of an English writer
of the seventeenth century, and in those of the French
philosopher, Helvetius, in the eighteenth century.
There is a fine ring of the best English spirit in the
sentence of Gittins: ‘A soldier ought to fear nothing
but God and dishonour.’ And there is the true
French wit and insight in that of Helvetius: ‘Discipline
is but the art of inspiring soldiers with more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
fear for their own officers than they have for the
enemy.’<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>But the difference involved lies less in the national
character of the writers than in the lapse of time
between them, discipline having by degrees gained
so greatly in severity that a soldier had come to be
regarded less as a moral free agent than as a mechanical
instrument, who, if he had any fear left for God
and dishonour, felt it in a very minor degree to that
which he cherished for his colonel or commander. This
is the broad fact which explains and justifies the proposition
of Helvetius; though no one, recollecting the
evils of the days of looser discipline, might see cause
to regret the change which deprived a soldier almost
entirely of the moral liberty that naturally belonged
to him as a man.</p>

<p>The tendency of discipline to become more and
more severe has of course the effect of rendering
military service less popular, and consequently recruiting
more difficult, without, unhappily, any corresponding
diminution in the frequency of wars, which
are independent of the hirelings who fight them.
Were it otherwise, something might be said for the
military axiom, that a soldier enjoys none of the
common rights of man. There is therefore no gain
from any point of view in denying to the military
class the enjoyment of the rights and privileges of
ordinary humanity.</p>

<p>The extent of this denial and its futility may be
shown by reference to army regulations concerning
marriage and religious worship. In the Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
army, till 1870, marriages were legally null and void
and the offspring of them illegitimate in the case of
officers marrying without royal consent, or of subordinate
officers without the consent of the commander
of their regiments. But after the Franco-German
war so great was the social disorder found to be
consequent upon these restrictions, that a special law
had to be made to remove the bar of illegitimacy from
the marriages in question.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> In the English army the
inability of privates to marry before the completion of
seven years’ service, and the possession of at least one
badge, and then only with the consent of the commanding
officer, is a custom so entirely contrary to
the liberty enjoyed in other walks of life, that, whatever
its incidental advantages, it can scarcely fail to
act as a deterring motive when the choice of a career
becomes a subject of reflection.</p>

<p>The custom of what is known in the army as
Church Parade affords another instance of the unreasonable
curtailments of individual liberty that are
still regarded as essential to discipline. A soldier is
drummed to church just as he is drummed to the
drill-ground or the battle-field. His presence in church
is a matter of compulsion, not of choice or conviction;
and the general principle that such attendance is
valueless unless it is voluntary is waived in his case
as in that of very young children, with whom, in this
respect, he is placed on a par. If we inquire for the
origin of the practice, we shall probably find it in
certain old Saxon and imperial articles of war, which
show that the prayers of the military were formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
regarded as equally efficacious with their swords in
obtaining victories over their enemies; and therefore
as a very necessary part of their duty.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The American
articles of war, since 1806, enact that ‘it is earnestly
recommended to all officers and soldiers to attend
divine service,’ thus obviating in a reasonable way all
the evils inevitably connected with a purely compulsory,
and therefore humiliating, church parade.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>It may be that these restrictions of a soldier’s
liberty are necessary; but if they are, and if, as Lord
Macaulay says, soldiers must, ‘for the sake of public
freedom, in the midst of public freedom, be placed
under a despotic rule,’ ‘must be subject to a sharper
penal code and to a more stringent code of procedure
than are administered by the ordinary tribunals,’ so
that acts, innocent in the citizen or only punished
slightly, become crimes, capitally punishable, when
committed by them, then at least we need no longer
be astonished that it should be almost as difficult to
entrap a recruit as to catch a criminal.</p>

<p>But over and above the intrinsic disadvantages of
military service, it would almost seem as if the war-presiding
genii had of set purpose essayed to make it
as distasteful as possible to mankind. For they have
made discipline not merely a curtailment of liberty
and a forfeiture of rights, but, as it were, an experiment
on the extreme limits of human endurance. There has
been no tyranny in the world, political, judicial, or
ecclesiastical, but has had its parent and pattern in some
military system. It has been from its armies more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
than from its kings that our world has learnt its lesson
of arbitrary tribunals, tortures, and cruel punishments.
The Inquisition itself could scarcely have devised a
more excruciating punishment than the old English
military one of riding the Wooden Horse, when the
victim was made to sit astride planks nailed together
in a sharp ridge, so as roughly to resemble a horse,
with his hands tied behind him, and muskets fixed to
his legs to drag them downwards; or again, than the
punishment of the Picket, in which the hand was
fastened to a hook in a post above the head, and the
man’s suspended body left to be supported by his
bare heel resting on a wooden stump, of which the
end was cut to the sharpness of a sword point.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> The
punishment of running the gauntlet (from the German
<i>Gassenlaufen</i>, street running, because the victim ran
through the street between two lines of soldiers who
tormented him on his course) is said to have been
invented by Gustavus Adolphus; and is perhaps,
from the fact of thus bringing the cruelty of many
men to bear on a single comrade, the most cowardly
form of torture that has ever yet found favour among
military authorities.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>But the penal part of military discipline, with its
red-hot irons, its floggings, and its various forms of
death, is too repulsive to do more than glance at as
testimony of the cruelty and despotism that have
never been separated from the calling of arms. The
art of the disciplinarian has ever been to bring such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
series of miseries to bear upon a man’s life that the
prospect of death upon the battle-field should have
for him rather charms than terrors; and the tale of
the soldier who, when his regiment was to be decimated,
drew a blank without the fatal D upon it, and immediately
offered it to a comrade, who had not yet drawn,
for half-a-crown, shows at how cheap a rate men may
be reduced to value their lives after experience of the
realities of a military career.</p>

<p>Many of the devices are curious by which this
indifference to life has been matured and sustained.
In ancient Athens the public temples were closed to
those who refused military service, who deserted their
ranks or lost their bucklers; whilst a law of Charondas
of Catana constrained such offenders to sit for three
days in the public forum dressed in the garments of
women. Many a Spartan mother would stab her son
who came back alive from a defeat; and such a man,
if he escaped his mother, was debarred not only from
public offices but from marriage; exposed to the
blows of all who chose to strike him; compelled to
dress in mean clothing, and to wear his beard negligently
trimmed. And in the same way a Norse
soldier who fled, or lost his shield, or received a wound
in any save the front part of his body, was by law
prevented from ever afterwards appearing in public.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>There are, indeed, few military customs but have
their origin and explanation in the artificial promotion
of courage in the minds of the combatants. This is
true even to the details and peculiarities of costume.
English children are, perhaps, still taught that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
French soldiers wear red trousers in order that the
sight of blood may not frighten them in war-time;
and doubtless French children imbibe a similar theory
regarding the red coats of the English. The same
reason was given by Julius Ferretus in the middle of
the sixteenth century for the short red frock then
generally worn by the military.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The first mention
of red as a special military colour in England is said
to have been the order issued in 1526 for the coats of
all yeomen of the household to be of red cloth.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> But
the colour goes, at least, as far back as Lycurgus,
the Spartan lawgiver, who chose it, according to
Xenophon, because red is most easily taken by cloth
and most lasting; according to Plutarch, that its
brightness might help to raise the spirits of its
wearers; or, according to Ælian and Valerius Maximus,
in order to conceal the sight of blood, that raw
soldiers might not be dispirited and the enemy proportionately
encouraged.</p>

<p>The bear-skin hats, which still make some English
regiments so ridiculous and unsightly, were originally
no doubt intended to inspire terror. Evelyn, writing
of the year 1678, says: ‘Now were brought into
service a new sort of soldiers called Grenadiers,
who were dexterous in flinging hand-grenades, every
man having a handful. They had furred caps with
coped crowns like Janizaries, which made them look
very fierce; and some had long hoods hanging down
behind as we picture fools.’ We may fairly identify
the motive of such headgear with the result; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the more so since the looking fierce with the borrowed
skins of bears was a well-known artifice of the
ancient Romans. Thus Vegetius speaks of helmets
as covered with bear-skins in order to terrify the
enemy,<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and Virgil has a significant description of a
warrior as</p>

<p class="center">Horridus in jaculis et pelle Libystidis ursæ.</p>

<p>We may trace the same motive again in the figures
of fierce birds or beasts depicted on flags and shields
and helmets, whence they have descended with less
harmful purpose to crests and armorial bearings.
Thus the Cimbri, whom Marius defeated, wore on
their plume-covered helmets the head of some fierce
animal with its mouth open, vainly hoping thereby to
intimidate the Romans. The latter, before it became
customary to display the images of their emperors
on their standards, reared aloft the menacing representations
of dragons, tigers, wolves, and such like;
and the figure of a dragon in use among the Saxons
at the time of the Conquest, and after that event retained
by the early Norman princes among the ensigns
of war,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> may reasonably be attributed to the same
motive. The legend of St. George killing the Dragon,
if it is not a survival of Theseus and the Minotaur,
very likely originated as a myth, intended to be explanatory
of the custom.</p>

<p>Lastly, under this head should be mentioned
Villani’s account of the English armour worn in the
thirteenth century, where he describes how the pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
studied to keep it clean and bright, so that when their
masters came to action their armour shone like
looking glass and gave them a more terrifying appearance.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
Was the result here again the motive, and
must we look for the primary cause of the great solicitude
still paid to the brightness of accoutrements
to the hope thereby to add a pang the more to the
terror desirable to instil into an enemy?</p>

<p>Such were some of the artificial supports supplied
to bravery in former times. But there is all the
difference in the world between the bravery appealed
to by our ancestors and that required since the revolution
effected in warfare by the invention of gunpowder.
Before that epoch, the use of catapults,
bows, or other missiles did not deduct from the paramount
importance of personal valour. The brave
soldier of olden times displayed the bravery of a man
who defied a force similar or equal to his own, and
against which the use of his own right hand and intellect
might help him to prevail; but his modern
descendant pits his bravery mainly against hazard,
and owes it to chance alone if he escape alive from a
battle. However higher in kind may be the bravery
required to face a shower of shrapnel than to contend
against swords and spears, it is assuredly a bravery
that involves rather a blind trust in luck than a
rational trust in personal fortitude.</p>

<p>So thoroughly indeed was this change foreseen and
appreciated that at every successive advance in the
methods of slaughter curious fears for the total extinction
of military courage have haunted minds too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
readily apprehensive, and found sometimes remarkable
expression. When the catapult<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> was first
brought from Sicily to Greece, King Archidamus saw
in it the grave of true valour; and the sentiment
against firearms, which led Bayard to exclaim, ‘C’est
une honte qu’un homme de cœur soit exposé à périr par
une miserable friquenelle,’ was one that was traceable
even down to the last century in the history of
Europe. For Charles XII. of Sweden is declared by
Berenhorst to have felt keenly the infamy of such a
mode of fighting; and Marshal Saxe held musketry
fire in such contempt that he even went so far as to
advocate the reintroduction of the lance, and a return
to the close combats customary in earlier times.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>But our military codes contain no reflection of the
different aspects under which personal bravery enters
into modern, as compared with ancient, warfare; and
this omission has tended to throw governments back
upon pure force and compulsion, as the only possible
way of recruiting their regiments. The old Roman
military punishments, such as cruelly scourging a man
before putting him to death, afford certainly no models
of a lenient discipline; but when we read of companies
who lost their colours being for punishment only
reduced to feed on barley instead of wheat, and reflect
that death by shooting would be the penalty under
the discipline of most modern nations<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> for an action
bearing any complexion of cowardice, it is impossible
to admit that a rational adjustment of punishments to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
offences is at all better observed in the war articles
of the moderns than in the military codes of pagan
antiquity.</p>

<p>This, at least, is clear, from the history of military
discipline, that only by the most repressive laws, and
by a tyranny subversive of the commonest rights of
men, is it possible to retain men in the fighting
service of a country, after forcing or cajoling them into
it. And this consideration fully meets the theory of
an inherent love of fighting dominating human
nature, such as that contended for in a letter from
Lord Palmerston to Cobden, wherein he argues that
man is by nature a fighting and quarrelling animal.
The proposition is true undoubtedly of some savage
races, and of the idle knights of the days of chivalry,
but, not even in those days, of the lower classes, who
incurred the real dangers of war, and still less of the
unfortunate privates or conscripts of modern armies.
Fighting is only possible between civilised countries,
because discipline first fits men for war and for nothing
else, and then war again necessitates discipline.
Nor is anything gained by ignoring the conquests that
have already been won over the savage propensity
to war. Single States no longer suffer private wars
within their boundaries, like those customary between
the feudal barons; we decide most of our quarrels
in law courts, not upon battle-fields, and wisely prefer
arguments to arms. A population as large as
that of Ireland and about double as large as that
of all our colonies in Australia put together lives
in London alone, not only without weapons of defence
in their hands, but with so little taste for blood-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>encounters
that you may walk for whole days through
its length and breadth without so much as seeing a
single street-fight. If then this miracle of social order
has been achieved, why not the wider one of that
harmony between nations which requires but a little
common-sense and determination on the part of those
most concerned in order to become an accomplished
reality?</p>

<p>The limitations of personal liberty already alluded
to would of themselves suffice in a country of free
institutions to render the military profession distasteful
and unpopular. The actual perils of war,
at no time greater than those of mines, railways,
or merchant-shipping, would never alone deter men
from service; so that we must look for other causes
to explain the difficulty of recruiting and the frequency
of desertion, which are the perplexity of military
systems still based, as our own is, on the principle of
voluntary not compulsory enlistment.</p>

<p>What then makes a military life so little an object
of desire in countries where it can be avoided is more
than its dangers, more even than its loss of liberty, its
irredeemable and appalling dulness. The shades in
point of cheerfulness must be few and fine which distinguish
a barrack from a convict prison. In none of
the employments of civil life is there anything to compare
with the unspeakable monotony of parades, recurring
three or four times every day, varied perhaps
in wet weather by the military catechism, and with
the intervals of time spent in occupations of neither
interest nor dignity. The length of time devoted
to the mere cleaning and polishing of accoutrements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
is such, that the task has actually come to have the
name ‘soldiering’; and the work which comes next
in importance to this soldiering is the humble one of
peeling potatoes for dinner. Even military greatcoats
require on a moderate estimate half a hour or more
every day to be properly folded, the penalty of an
additional hour’s drill being the probable result of
any carelessness in this highly important military
function. But for the attention thus given to military
dress the author of the ‘Soldier’s Pocket Book’
supplies us with a reason: ‘The better you dress a
soldier, the more highly he will be thought of by
women and consequently by himself.’</p>

<p>Still less calculated to lend attractiveness to the
life of the ranks are the daily fatigue works, or extra
duties which fall in turn on the men of every company,
such as coal carrying, passage cleaning, gutter clearing,
and other like menial works of necessity.</p>

<p>But it is the long hours of sentry duty, popularly
called ‘Sentry-go,’ which constitute the soldier’s
greatest bane. Guard duty in England, recurring at
short periods, lasts a whole day and night, every four
hours of the twenty-four being spent in full accoutrements
in the guard-room, and every intervening two
hours on active sentry, thus making in all&mdash;sixteen
hours in the guard-room, and eight on the sentry post.
The voluntary sufferings of the saints, the tortures
devised by the religious orders of olden days, or the
self-inflicted hardships of sport, pale before the two
hours’ sentry-go on a winter’s night. This it is that
kills our soldiers more fatally than an enemy’s cannon,
and is borne with more admirable patience than even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the hardships of a siege. ‘After about thirty-one
or thirty-two years of age,’ says Sir F. Roberts, ‘the
private soldier usually ages rapidly, and becomes a
veteran both in looks and habits;’<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and this distinguished
military commander points to excessive sentry
duty as the cause.</p>

<p>But, possible as it thus is, by rigour of discipline,
to produce in a soldier total indifference to death, by
depriving him of everything that makes life desirable,
it is impossible to produce indifference to tedium;
and a policy is evidently self-destructive which, by
aiming exclusively at producing a mechanical character,
renders military service itself so unpopular that only
the young, the inexperienced, or the ill-advised will
join the colours at all; that 10 per cent. of those who
do join them will desert; and that the rest will regard
it as the gala day of their lives when they become
legally entitled to their discharge from the ranks.</p>

<p>In England about 10 per cent. of the recruits
desert every year, as compared with 50 per cent. from
the small army of the United States. The reason
for so great a difference is probably not so much that
the American discipline is more severe or dull than
the English, as that in the newer country, where subsistence
is easier, the counter-attractions of peaceful
trades offer more plentiful inducements to desertion.</p>

<p>Desertion from the English ranks has naturally
diminished since the introduction of the short-service
system has set a visible term to the hardships of a military
life. Adherence to the colours for seven or eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
years, or even for twelve, which is now the longest service
possible at the time of enlistment, and adherence to
them for life, clearly place a very different complexion
on the desirability of an illegal escape from them. So
that considering the reductions that have been made
in the term of service, and the increase of pay made
in 1867, and again in 1873, nothing more strongly
demonstrates the national aversion of the English
people to arms than the exceeding difficulty with
which the ranks are recruited, and the high average
of the percentage of desertions. If of recent years
recruiting has been better, the explanation is simply
that trade has been worse; statistics of recruiting
being the best possible barometer of the state of the
nation, since the scarcity or abundance of recruits
varies concomitantly with the brisk or slack demand
for labour in other employments.</p>

<p>In few things has the world grown more tolerant
than in its opinion and treatment of Desertion.
Death was once its certain penalty, and death with
every aggravation that brutal cruelty could add.
Two of Rome’s most famous generals were Scipio
Æmilianus and Paulus Æmilius; yet the former consigned
deserters to fight wild beasts at the public
games, and the latter had them trodden to death by
elephants.</p>

<p>A form of desertion, constituting one of the most
curious but least noticed chapters in the history of
military discipline, is that of Malingering, or the
feigning of sickness, and self-mutilation, disabling
from service. The practice goes far back into history.
Cicero tells of a man who was sold for a slave for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
having cut off a finger, in order to escape from a
campaign in Sicily. Vegetius, the great authority
on Roman discipline, speaks of soldiers who simulated
sickness being punished as traitors;<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> and an
old English writer on the subject says of the Romans:
‘Whosoever mutilated their own or their children’s
bodies so as thereby designedly to render them unfit
to carry arms (a practice common enough in those
elder times when all were pressed to the wars), were
adjudicated to perpetual exile.’<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The writer here referred to lived long before the
days of the conscription, with which he fancied self-mutilation
to be connected. And it certainly seems
that whereas all the military codes of modern nations
contain articles dealing with that offence, and decreeing
penalties against it, there was less of it in the
days before compulsory service. There is, for instance,
no mention of it in the German articles of war of the
seventeenth century, though the other military crimes
were precisely those that are common enough still.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>But even in England, where soldiers are not yet
military slaves, it has been found necessary to deal,
by specific clauses in the army regulations, with a
set of facts of which there is no notice in the war
articles of the seventeenth or eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
The inference therefore is, that the conditions of
military service have become universally more disagreeable.
The clauses in the actual war articles
deserve to be quoted, that it may appear, by the
provisions against it, to what lengths the arts of self-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>mutilation
are carried by despairing men. The 81st
Article of War provides punishment against any
soldier in Her Majesty’s army ‘who shall malinger,
feign or produce disease or infirmity, or shall wilfully
do any act or wilfully disobey any orders whether in
hospital or otherwise, thereby producing or aggravating
disease or infirmity or delaying his cure, ...
or who shall maim or injure himself or any other
soldier, whether at the instance of such other soldier
or not, or cause himself to be maimed or injured by
any other person with intent thereby to render himself
or such other soldier unfit for service, ... or who
shall tamper with his eyes with intent thereby to
render himself unfit for service.’</p>

<p>That it should be necessary thus to provide against
self-inflicted injuries is surely commentary enough on
the condition of life in the ranks. The allusion to
tampering with the eyes may be illustrated from a
passage in the ‘Life of Sir C. Napier,’ wherein we are
told how in the year 1808 a private of the 28th Regiment
taught his fellow-soldiers to produce artificial
ophthalmia by holding their eyelids open, whilst a
comrade in arms would scrape some lime from the
barrack ceiling into their eyes.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> For a profession of
which such things are common incidents, surely the
wonder is, not that it should be difficult, but that it
should be possible at all, to make recruits. In the days
of Mehemet Ali in Egypt, so numerous were the cases
in which the natives voluntarily blinded themselves,
and even their children, of one eye in order to escape
the conscription, that Mehemet Ali is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
found himself under the necessity of raising a one-eyed
regiment. Others for the same purpose would chop
off the trigger finger of the right hand, or disable
themselves from biting cartridges by knocking out
some of their upper teeth. Scarcely a peasant in the
fields but bore the trace of some such voluntarily
inflicted disfigurement. But with such facts it seems
idle to talk of any inherent love for fighting dominating
the vast majority of mankind.</p>

<p>The severity of military discipline has even a
worse effect than those yet alluded to in its tendency
to demoralise those who are long subject to it, by inducing
mental habits of servility and baseness. After
Alexander the Great had killed Clitus in a fit of
drunken rage, the Macedonian soldiery voted that
Clitus had been justly slain, and prayed that he might
not enjoy the rites of sepulture.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Military servility
could scarcely go further than that, but such baseness
is only possible under a state of discipline which, to
make a soldier, unmakes a man, by depriving him of
all that distinguishes his species. Under no other than
military training, and in no other than the military
class, would the atrocities have been possible which
used to be perpetrated in the barrack riding-school
in the old flogging days. Officers and privates needed
the debasing influence of discipline to enable them to
look on as patient spectators at the sufferings of a
helpless comrade tortured by the cat-o’-nine tails. Sir
C. Napier said that as a subaltern he ‘frequently saw
600, 700, 800, 900, and 1,000 lashes sentenced by
regimental courts-martial and generally every lash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
inflicted;’ a feeling of horror would run through the
ranks at the first blows and some recruits would faint,
but that was all.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Had they been men and not
soldiers, they would not have stood such iniquities.
A typical instance of this martial justice or law (to
employ the conventional profanation of those words)
was that of a sergeant who in 1792 was sentenced to
1,000 lashes for having enlisted two drummers for
the East India Company whom he knew to belong
already to the Foot Guards; but the classical description
of an English flogging will always be Somerville’s
account of its infliction upon himself in his ‘Autobiography
of a Working Man.’<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> There you may
read how the regiment was drawn up four-deep inside
the riding-school; how the officers (men of gentle
birth and breeding) stood within the lines of the men;
how the basin of water and towels were ready prepared
in case the victim should faint; how the hands
and feet of the latter were fastened to a ladder by a
rope; and how the regimental sergeant-major stood
with book and pencil coolly counting each stroke as it
was delivered with slow and deliberate torture till the
full complement of a hundred lashes had been inflicted.
The mere reading of it even now is enough to make
the blood boil, but that men, brave and freeborn,
should have stood by in their hundreds and seen the
actual reality without stirring, proves how utterly all
human feeling is eradicable by discipline, and how
sure is the training it supplies in disregard for the
common claims of humanity.</p>

<p>Happily, floggings in the English army now count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
among the curiosities of military discipline, like the
wooden horse or the thumb-screw; but the striking
thing is that the discipline, in the sense of the good
conduct of the army in the field, was never worse
than in the days when 1,000 lashes were common
sentences. It was precisely when courts-martial had
the legal power to exercise such tyranny that the Duke
of Wellington complained to Lord Castlereagh that
the law was not strong enough to maintain discipline
in an army upon actual service.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Speaking of the
army in the Peninsula he says: ‘It is impossible to
describe to you the irregularities and outrages committed
by the troops; ... there is not an outrage of
any description which has not been committed on a
people who have received us as friends by soldiers
who never yet for one moment suffered the slightest
want or the smallest privation.... We are an excellent
army on parade, an excellent one to fight, but
we are worse than an enemy in a country.’ And again
a few months later: ‘I really believe that more plunder
and outrage have been committed by this army than
by any other that was ever in the field.’ In the
general order of May 19, 1809, are these words: ‘The
officers of companies must attend to the men in their
quarters as well as on the march, or the army will
soon be no better than a banditti.’<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Whence it is fair to infer that severity of discipline
has no necessary connection with the good behaviour
or easy control of troops in the field, such discipline
under the Iron Duke himself having been conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
for so lamentable a failure. The real fact would seem
to be, that troops are difficult to manage just in proportion
to the rigour, the monotony, and the dulness
of the discipline imposed upon them in time of peace;
the rebound corresponding to the compression, by a
moral law that seems to follow the physical one. This
fact is nowhere better noticed than in Lord Wolseley’s
narrative of the China war of 1860, where he says, in
allusion to the general love of pillage and destruction
that characterises soldiers and was so conspicuously
displayed at the shameful burning of the beautiful
palaces in and round Pekin: ‘Soldiers are nothing
more than grown-up schoolboys. The wild moments
of enjoyment passed in the pillage of a place live long
in a soldier’s memory.... Such a time forms so
marked a contrast with the ordinary routine of existence
passed under the tight hand of discipline that it
becomes a remarkable event in life and is remembered
accordingly.’<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The experience of the Peninsular war proves how
slender is the link between a well-drilled and a well-disciplined
army. The best disciplined army is the
one which conducts itself with least excess in the field
and is least demoralised by victory. It is the hour of
victory that is the great test of the value of military
regulations; and so well aware of this was the best
disciplined State of antiquity, that the soldiers of
Sparta desisted from pursuit as soon as victory was
assured to them, partly because it was deemed ungenerous
to destroy those who could make no further
resistance (a sentiment absolutely wanting from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
boasted chivalry of Christian warfare), and partly that
the enemy might be tempted to prefer flight to resistance.
It is a reproach to modern generalship that it
has been powerless to restrain such excesses as those
which have made the successful storming of cities
rather a disgrace than an honour to those who have
won them. The only way to check them is to make
the officers responsible for what occurs, as might be
done, for instance, by punishing a general capitally
for storming a city with forces so badly disciplined
as to nullify the advantages of success. An English
military writer, speaking of the storming of Ismail
and Praga by the Russians under Suwarrow, says
truly that ‘posterity will hold the fame and honour
of the commander responsible for the life of every
human being sacrificed by disciplined armies beyond
the fair verge of battle;’ but it is idle to speak as if
only Russian armies were guilty of such excesses, or
to say that nothing but the prospect of them could
tempt the Russian soldier to mount the breach or
the scaling-ladder. The Russian soldier in history
yields not one whit to the English or French in
bravery, nor is there a grain of difference between
the Russian storming of Ismail and Praga and the
English storming of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, or San
Sebastian, that tarnished the lustre of the British arms
in the famous Peninsular war.</p>

<p>And should we be tempted to think that successes
like these associated with the names of these places
may be so important in war as to outweigh all other
considerations, we must also not forget that the permanent
military character of nations, for humanity or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the reverse, counts for more in the long run of a
people’s history than any advantage that can possibly
be gained in a single campaign.</p>

<p>Enough has, perhaps, been said of the unpopularity
of military service, and of the obvious causes
thereof, to make it credible that, had the system of
conscription never been resorted to in Europe, and the
principle of voluntary enlistment remained intact and
universal, the difficulty of procuring the human fighting
material in sufficient quantities would in course
of time have rendered warfare impossible. As other
industries than mere fighting have won their way in
the world, the difficulty of hiring recruits to sell their
lives to their country has kept even pace with the
facility of obtaining livelihoods in more regular and
more lucrative as well as less miserable avocations.
In the fourteenth century soldiers were very highly
paid compared with other classes, and the humblest
private received a daily wage equivalent to that of a
skilled mechanic;<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> but the historical process has so
far reversed matters that now the pay of the humblest
mechanic would compare favourably with that of all
the fighting grades lower than the commissioned and
warrant ranks. Consequently, every attempt to make
the service popular has as yet been futile, no amelioration
of it enabling it to compete with pacific occupations.
The private’s pay was raised from sixpence
to a shilling during the wars of the French Revolution;<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
and before that it was found necessary, about
the time of the war with the American colonies, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
bribe men to enlist by the system (since abolished) of
giving bounties at the time of enlistment. Previous
to the introduction of the bounty system, a guinea to
provide the recruit with necessaries and a crown
wherewith to drink the king’s health was all that was
given upon enlistment, the service itself (with the
chances of loot and the allied pleasures) having been
bounty enough.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Even the system of bounties proved
attractive only to boys; for as the English statesman
said, whose name is honourably associated with the first
change in our system from enlistment for life to enlistment
for a limited period, ‘men grown up with all the
grossness and ignorance and consequent want of consideration
incident to the lower classes’ were too wary
to accept the offers of the recruiting department.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>The shortening of the term of service in 1806 and
subsequently the increase of pay, the mitigation of
punishments, must all be understood as attempts to
render the military life more attractive and more capable
of competing with other trades; but that they
have all signally failed is proved by the chronic and
ever-increasing difficulty of decoying recruits. The
little pamphlet, published by authority and distributed
gratis at every post-office in the kingdom, showing
forth ‘the Advantages of the Army’ in their rosiest
colours, cannot counteract the influence of the oral
evidence of men, who, after a short period of service,
are dispersed to all corners of the country, with their
tales of military misery to tell, confirming and propagating
that popular theory of a soldier’s life which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
sees in it a sort of earthly purgatory for faults of
character acquired in youth, a calling only to be
adopted by those whose antecedents render industry
distasteful to them, and unfit them for more useful
pursuits.</p>

<p>The same difficulty of recruiting was felt in France
and Germany in the last century, when voluntary
enlistment was still the rule. In that curious old
military book, Fleming’s ‘Volkommene Teutsche
Soldat,’ is a picture of the recruiting officer, followed
by trumpeters and drummers, parading the streets,
and shaking a hat full of silver coins near a table
spread with the additional temptations of wine and
beer.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> But it soon became necessary to supplement
this system by coercive methods; and when the
habitual neglect of the wounded and the great
number of needless wars made it difficult or impossible
to fill up the ranks with fresh recruits, the
German authorities resorted to a regular system of
kidnapping, taking men as they could get them from
their ploughs, their churches, or even from their very
beds.</p>

<p>In France, too, Louis XIV. had to resort to force
for filling his ranks in the war of the Spanish Succession;
although the system of recruiting remained
nominally voluntary till very much later. The total
cost of a French recruit amounted to ninety-two
livres; but the length of his service, though it was
changed from time to time from periods varying from
three to eight years, never exceeded the latter limit, nor
came to be for life as it did practically in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>The experience of other countries proves, therefore,
that England will sooner or later adopt the
principle of conscription or cease to waste blood and
money in Continental quarrels. The conscription
will be for her the only possible way of obtaining an
army at all, or one at all commensurate with those of
her possible European rivals. We should not forget
that in 1878, when we were on the verge of a war
with Russia (and we live always on the verge of a war
with Russia), our best military experts met and agreed
that only by means of compulsory service could we
hope to cope with our enemy with any chance of
success. And the conscription, whether under a free
government or not, means a tyranny compared to which
the tyrannies of the Tudors or Stuarts were as a yoke
of silk to a yoke of iron. It would matter little that
it should lead to or involve a political despotism,
for the greater despotism would ever be the military
one, crushing out all individuality, moral liberty, and
independence, and consigning to the soul-destroying
routine of petty military details all the talent, taste,
knowledge, and wealth of our country, which have
hitherto given it a distinctive character in history, and
a foremost place among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>In the year 1702 a woman served as a captain in
the French army with such signal bravery that she
was rewarded with the Order of St. Louis. Nor was
this the only result; for the episode roused a serious
debate in the world, whether, or not, military service
might be expected of, or exacted from, the female sex
generally.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Why, then, should the conscription be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
confined to one half only of a population, in the face
of so many historical instances of women who have
shown pre-eminent, or at least average, military capacity?
And if military service is so ennobling and
excellent a thing, as it is said to be, for the male
population of a country, why not also for the female?
Or as we may be sure that it would be to the last
degree debasing for the latter half of the community,
may we not suspect that the reasoning is altogether
sophistical which claims other effects as the consequence
of its operation on the stronger sex?</p>

<p>What those effects are likely to be on the further
development of European civilisation, we are as yet
scarcely in a position to judge. We are still living
only on the threshold of the change, and can hardly
estimate the ultimate effect on human life of the
transference to the whole male population of a country
of the habits and vices previously confined to only a
section of it. But this at least is certain, that at
present every prediction which ushered in the change
is being falsified from year to year. This universal
service which we call the conscription was, we were
told, to usher in a sort of millennium; it was to
have the effect of humanising warfare; of raising the
moral tone of armies; and of securing peace, by
making the prospect of its alternative too appalling
to mankind. Not only has it done none of these
things, but there are even indications of consequences
the very reverse. The amenities that cast occasional
gleams over the professional hostilities of the eighteenth
century, as when, for instance, Crillon besieging
Gibraltar sent a cart-load of carrots to the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
governor, whose men were dying of scurvy, have
passed altogether out of the pale of possibility, and
given place to a hatred between the combatant forces
that is tempered by no courtesy nor restrained by the
shadow of humanity. Whole nations, instead of a
particular class, have been familiarised with deeds of
robbery and bloodshed, and parted with a large part
of their leisure once available for progress in industry.
War itself is at any given moment infinitely more
probable than it used to be, from the constant expectation
of it which comes of constant preparation;
nothing having been proved falser by history than
the popular paradox which has descended to us from
Vegetius that the preparation for war is the high road
to peace.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> When, one may ask, has the world not
been prepared for war, and how then has it had so
much of it? And as to the higher moral tone likely
to spring from universal militarism, of what kind may
we expect it to be, when we read in a work by the
greatest living English general, destined, Carlyle
hoped, one day to make short work of Parliament,
such an exposition as the following of the relation
between the moral duties of a soldier and those of a
civilian: ‘He (the soldier) must be taught to believe
that his duties are the noblest which fall to a man’s
lot. He must be taught to despise all those of civil
life. Soldiers, like missionaries, must be fanatics.’<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus once observed in a letter to a friend how
little it mattered to most men to what nationality they
belonged, seeing that it was only a question of paying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
taxes to Thomas instead of to John, or to John
instead of to Thomas; but it becomes a matter of
even less importance when it is only a question of
being trained for murder and bloodshed in the drill-yards
of this or that government. What is it to a
conscript whether it is for France or Germany that
he is forced to undergo drill and discipline, when the
insipidity of the drill and the tyranny of the discipline
is the same in either case? If the old definition
of a man as a reasoning animal is to be exchanged
for that of a fighting animal, and the claims of a
country upon a man are to be solely or mainly in
respect of his fighting utility, it is evident that the
relation is altered between the individual and his
country, and that there is no longer any tie of affection
between them, nor anything to make one nationality
different from or preferable to another. This is
clearly the tendency of the conscription; and it is
already remarkable how it has lessened those earlier
and narrower views of patriotism which were the
pretext formerly for so many trials of strength between
nations. What, then, are the probable ultimate
effects of this innovation on the development and
maintenance of the peace in Europe?</p>

<p>The conscription, by reducing the idea of a country
to that merely of a military despotism, has naturally
caused the differences between nations to sink into a
secondary place, and to be superseded by those differences
of class, opinions, and interests which are
altogether independent of nationality, and regardless
of the barriers of language or geography. Thus the
artisan of one country has learnt to regard his fellow-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>worker
of another country as in a much truer sense
his countryman than the priest or noble who, because
he lives in the same geographical area as himself, pays
his taxes to the same central government; and the
different political schools in the several countries of
Europe have far more in common with one another
than with the opposite party of their own nationality.
So that the first effect of that great military engine,
the conscription, has been to unloosen the bonds of
the idea of nationality which has so long usurped the
title to patriotism; to free us from that notion of our
duty towards our neighbour which bids us hate him
because he is our neighbour; and to diminish to that
extent the chances of war by the undermining of the
prejudice which has ever been its mainstay.</p>

<p>But the conscription in laying one spectre has
raised another; for over against Nationalism, the
jealousy of nations, it has reared Socialism, the
jealousy of classes. It has done so, not only by
weakening the old national idea which kept the
rivalry of classes in abeyance, but by the pauperism,
misery, and discontent which are necessarily involved
in the addition it causes to military expenditure. The
increase caused by it is so enormous as to be almost
incredible. In France the annual military expenditure
is now about twenty-five million pounds, whereas
in 1869, before the new law of universal liability to
service, the total annual cost of the army was little
over fifteen millions, or the average annual cost of
the present army of Great Britain. ‘Nothing,’ said
Froissart, ‘drains a treasury like men-at-arms;’
and it is probably below the truth to say that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
country is the poorer by a pound for every shilling
it expends upon its army. Thus by the nature of
things is Socialism seen to flow from the conscription;
and we have only to look at the recent history of
Europe to see how the former has grown and spread
in exact ratio to the extension of the latter. That
it does not yet prevail so widely in England as in
France, or Germany, or Russia is because as yet we
have not that compulsory military service for which
our military advisers are beginning to clamour.</p>

<p>The growth of Socialism in its turn is not without
an effect that may prove highly beneficial as a solvent
of the militarism which is the uncompensated evil of
modern times. For it tends to compel the governments
of our different nationalities to draw closer together,
and, adopting some of the cosmopolitanism of their
common foe, to enter into league and union against
those enemies to actual institutions for whom militarism
itself is primarily responsible, owing to the
example so long set by it in methods of lawlessness,
to the sanction so long given by it to crime. With
Socialistic theories permeating every country, but
more especially those that groan under the conscription,
international jealousies are smothered and kept
down, and must, if the cause continues, ultimately die
out. Hence the curious result, but a result fraught
with hopefulness for the future, that the peace of the
world should owe itself now, in an indirect but clearly
traceable manner, to the military system which of all
others that was ever invented is the best calculated
to prevent and endanger it. But since this is merely

the imminent fear of civil war, little is gained by
the exchange of one peril for another. Socialism can
only be averted by removing the cause which gives
birth to it&mdash;namely, that unproductive expenditure
on military forces which intensifies and perpetuates
pauperism. So that the problem of the times for us
in England is not how we may obtain a more liberal
military expenditure, still less how we may compass
compulsory service; but rather how most speedily we
can disband our army&mdash;an ever-growing danger to
our peace and liberty&mdash;and how we can advance elsewhere
the cause of universal disarmament.</p>

<p>It must needs be that new questions arise, or old
perplexities in a fresh form; and of these one that has
risen again in our time is this: Does any moral stain
attach to bloodshed committed upon the battle-field?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Or is the difference between military and ordinary
homicide a real one, and does the plea of duty sanction
any act, however atrocious in the abstract, provided it
be committed under the uniform of the State?</p>

<p>The general opinion is, of course, that no soldier
in his military capacity can be guilty of crime; but
opinion has not always been so fixed, and it is worth
noticing that in the forms of civilisation that preceded
our own, and in some existing modern races of lower
type than our own, traces clearly appear of a sense of
wrong attaching to any form of bloodshed whatever,
whether of fair battle or of base treachery, calling alike
for the purifying influences of expiation and cleansing.
In South Africa, for instance, the Basuto returning from
war proceeds with all his arms to the nearest stream,
to purify not only his own person but his javelins and
his battle-axe. The Zulu, too, practises ablutions on
the same occasion; and the Bechuana warrior wears a
rude kind of necklace, to remind him of the expiation
due from him to the slain, and to disperse the dreams
that might otherwise trouble him, and perhaps even
drive him to die of remorse.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>The same feelings may be detected in the old world.
The Macedonians had a peculiar form of sacrificatory
purification, which consisted in cutting a dog in half
and leading the whole army, arrayed in full armour,
between the two parts.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> As the Bœotians had the
same custom, it was probably for the same reason. At
Rome, for the same purpose, a sheep, and a bull, and a
pig or boar, were every year led three times round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
army and then sacrificed to Mars. In Jewish history
the prohibition to King David to build the temple was
expressly connected with the blood he had shed in
battle. In old Greek mythology Theseus held himself
unfit, without expiation, to be admitted to the mysteries
of Ceres, though the blood that stained his hands was
only that of thieves and robbers. And in the same
spirit Hector refused to make a libation to the gods
before he had purified his hands after battle. ‘With
unwashen hands,’ he said, ‘to pour out sparkling wine
to Zeus I dare not, nor is it ever the custom for one
soiled with the blood and dust of battle to offer prayers
to the god whose seat is in the clouds.’<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>For the cause of this feeling we may perhaps choose
between an almost instinctive reluctance to take human
life, and some such superstition as explains the necessity
for purification among the Basutos,&mdash;the idea,
namely, of escaping the revenge of the slain by the
medium of water.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The latter explanation would be
in keeping with the not uncommon notion in savage
life of the inability of a spirit to cross running water,
and would help to account for the necessity there was
for a Hebrew to flee, or for a Greek to make some
expiation, even though only guilty of an act of unintentional
homicide. And in this way it is possible
that the sanctity of human life, which is one of the chief
marks, and should be one of the chief objects, of civilisation,
originated in the very same fear of a post-mortem
vengeance, which leads some savage tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to entreat pardon of the bear or elephant they have
slain after a successful chase.</p>

<p>But, account as we like for the origin of the feeling,
its undoubted existence is the point of interest, for it is
easy to see that under slightly more favourable conditions
of history it might have ripened into a state
of thought which would have held the soldier and the
manslayer in equal abhorrence. Christianity in its
primitive form certainly aimed at and very nearly
effected the transition. In the Greek Church a Christian
soldier was debarred from the Eucharist for three
years if he had slain an enemy in battle; and the
Christian Church of the first three centuries would have
echoed the sentiment expressed by St. Cyprian in his
letter to Donatus: ‘Homicide when committed by an
individual is a crime, but a virtue when committed in
a public war; yet in the latter case it derives its impunity,
not from its abstract harmlessness, but solely
from the scale of its enormity.’</p>

<p>The education of centuries has long since effaced
the earlier scruple; but there are tens of thousands of
Englishmen to whom the military profession is the last
they would voluntarily adopt, and it would be rash to
predict the impossibility of the revival of the older feeling,
or the dimensions it may ultimately assume. The
greatest poet of our time, who more than any other
living man has helped to lead European opinion into
new channels, may, perhaps, in the following lines
have anticipated the verdict of the coming time, and
divined an undercurrent of thought that is beginning
to flow even now amongst us with no inconsiderable
force of feeling:&mdash;</p>

<p>The destruction of the romance of war by the
greater publicity given to its details through the
medium of the press clearly tends to strengthen this
feeling, by tempering popular admiration for military
success with a cooling admixture of horror and disgust.
Take, for instance, the following description of the
storming of the Egyptian trenches at Tel-el-Kebir, by
an eye-witness of it:&mdash;‘In the redoubts into which
our men were swarming the Egyptians, throwing
away their arms, were found cowering, terror-stricken,
in the corners of the works, to hide themselves from
our men. Although they had made such a contemptible
exhibition, from a soldierly point of view, it
was impossible to help pitying the poor wretches as
they huddled together; <i>it seemed so much like rats in
a pit when the terrier has set to work</i>.’ And some
2,500 of them were afterwards buried on the spot,
most of them killed by bayonet wounds in the back.</p>

<p>This is an instance of the <i>tuerie</i> that Victor Hugo
speaks of, which we all call glorious when we meet in
the streets, reserving, some of us, another opinion for
the secret chamber. Still, when it comes to comparing
the work of a victory to that of a terrier in a rat-pit,
it must be admitted that the realism of war threatens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
to become more repellent than its romance was once
attractive, and to deter men more and more from the
choice of a profession of which similar disgusting
scenes are the common and the probable episodes.</p>

<p>Descartes, the father of modern philosophy and of
free thought, who, from a youthful love for arms and
camp-life, which he attributed to a certain heat of liver,
began life in the army, actually gave up his military
career for the reasons which he thus expressed in a letter
to a friend: ‘Although custom and example render the
profession of arms the noblest of all, I, for my own
part, who only regard it like a philosopher, value it at
its proper worth, and, indeed, I find it very difficult
to give it a place among the honourable professions,
seeing that idleness and licentiousness are the two
principal motives which now attract most men to
it.’<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>Of course no one in modern times would come
to the same conclusions as Descartes for the same
reasons, the discipline of our armies being somewhat
more serious than it was in the first half of the seventeenth
century. Nevertheless, it is impossible to
read of the German campaign in France without
hoping, for the good of the world, that the inevitable
association of war with the most revolting forms of
crime therein displayed, may some day produce a
general state of sentiment similar to that anticipated
by Descartes.</p>

<p>It may be, said that the example of Descartes
proves and indicates nothing; and we may feel
pretty sure that his scruples seemed extravagantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
absurd to his contemporaries, if he suffered them to
know them. Nevertheless, he might have appealed
to several well-known historical facts as a reason
against too hasty a condemnation of his apparent
super-sensitiveness. He might have argued that the
profession of a pirate once reflected no more moral
discredit than that of a soldier did in his days; that
the pirate’s reply to Alexander, that he infested the
seas by the same right wherewith the conqueror
devastated the land, conveyed a moral sentiment
once generally accepted, nor even then quite extinct;
that in the days of Homer it was as natural to ask a
seafarer whether he were a freebooter as whether he
were a merchant; that so late in Greek history as
the time of Thucydides, several tribes on the mainland
of Greece still gloried in piracy, and accounted
their plunder honourably won; and that at Rome
the Cilician pirates, whom it devolved on Pompey to
disperse, were joined by persons of wealth, birth, and
education, ‘as if,’ says Plutarch, ‘their employment
were worthy of the ambition of men of honour.’</p>

<p>Remembering, therefore, these things, and the
fact that not so very many centuries ago public
opinion was so lenient to the practice of bishops
and ecclesiastics taking an active part in warfare that
they commonly did so in spite of canons and councils
to the contrary, it is a fair subject for speculation
whether the moral opinion of the future may not
come to coincide with the feeling of Descartes, and it
behoves us to keep our minds alive to possibilities of
change in this matter, already it would seem in process
of formation. Who will venture to predict what may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
be the effect of the rise of the general level of education,
and of the higher moral life of our time, on
the popular judgment of even fifty years hence regarding
a voluntarily adopted military life?</p>

<p>We may, perhaps, attribute it to the extreme
position taken up with regard to military service by
the Quakers and Mennonites that the example of
Descartes had so slight a following. That thick
phalanx of our kind who fondly mistake their own
mental timidity for moderation, perpetually make use
of the doctrines of extremists as an excuse for tolerating
or even defending what in the abstract they
admit to be evil; and it was unfortunately with this
moderate party that Grotius elected to throw in his
lot. No one admitted more strongly the evils of war.
The reason he himself gave for writing his ‘De Jure
Pacis et Belli’ was the licence he saw prevailing
throughout Christendom in resorting to hostilities;
recourse had to arms for slight motives or for none;
and when war was once begun an utter rejection of
all reverence for divine or human law, just as if the
unrestrained commission of every crime became
thenceforth legitimate. Yet, instead of throwing the
weight of his judgment into the scale of opinion
which opposed the custom altogether (though he did
advocate an international tribunal that should decide
differences and compel obedience to its decisions), he
only tried to shackle it with rules of decency that are
absolutely foreign to it, with the result, after all, that
he did very little to humanise wars, and nothing to
make them less frequent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though Grotius admitted the abstract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
lawfulness of military service, he made it conditional
on a thorough conviction of the righteousness of the
cause at issue. This is the great and permanent
merit of his work, and it is here that we touch on the
pivot or central question of military ethics. The
orthodox theory is, that with the cause of war a
soldier has no concern, and that since the matter in
contention is always too complicated for him to judge
of its merits, his only duty is to blindfold his reason
and conscience, and rush whithersoever his services
are commanded. Perhaps the best exposition of this
simple military philosophy is that given by Shakespeare
in his scene of the eve of Agincourt, where
Henry V., in disguise, converses with some soldiers of
the English army. ‘Methinks,’ says the king, ‘I could
not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company,
his cause being just and his quarrel honourable.’</p>

<p><i>William.</i> ‘That’s more than we know.’</p>

<p><i>Bates.</i> ‘Ay, or more than we should seek after,
for we know enough if we know we are the king’s
subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to
the king wipes the crime of it out of us.’</p>

<p>Yet the whisper of our own day is, Does it? For
a soldier, nowadays, enjoys equally with the civilian,
who by his vote contributes to prevent or promote
hostilities, the greater facilities afforded by the spread
of knowledge for the exercise of his judgment; and
it is to subject him to undeserved ignominy to debar
him from the free use of his intellect, as if he were a
minor or an imbecile, incompetent to think for himself.
Putting even the difficulty of decision at its
worst, it can never be greater for the soldier than it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
for the voter; and if the former is incompetent to
form an opinion, whence does the peasant or mechanic
derive his ability? Moreover, the existence of a just
and good cause has always been the condition insisted
on as alone capable of sanctioning military service by
writers of every shade of thought&mdash;by St. Augustine
as representing the early Catholic Church, by Bullinger
or Becon as representatives of the early Reformed
Church, and by Grotius as representative of
the modern school of publicists. Grotius contends
that no citizen or subject ought to take part in an
unjust war, even if he be commanded to do so. He
openly maintains that disobedience to orders is in
such a case a lesser evil than the guilt of homicide
that would be incurred by fighting. He inclines to
the opinion that, where the cause of war seems
doubtful, a man would do better to refrain from
service, and to leave the king to employ those whose
readiness to fight might be less hampered by questions
of right and wrong, and of whom there would
always be a plentiful supply. Without these reservations
he regards the soldier’s task as so much the
more detestable than the executioner’s, as manslaughter
without a cause is more heinous than manslaughter
with one,<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and thinks no kind of life more
wicked than that of men who, without regard for the
cause of war, fight for hire, and to whom the question of
right is equivalent to the question of the highest wage.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>These are strong opinions and expressions, and
as their general acceptance would logically render
war impossible, it is no small gain to have in their
favour so great an authority as Grotius. But it is an
even greater gain to be able to quote on the same
side an actual soldier. Sir James Turner at the end
of his military treatise called ‘Pallas Armata,’ published
in 1683, came to conclusions which, though
adverse to Grotius, contain some remarkable admissions
and show the difference that two centuries have
made on military maxims with regard to this subject.
‘It is no sin for a mere soldier,’ he says, ‘to serve for
wages, unless his conscience tells him he fights in an
unjust cause.’ Again, ‘That soldier who serves or
fights for any prince or State for wages in a cause he
knows to be unjust, sins damnably.’ He even argues
that soldiers whose original service began for a just
cause, and who are constrained by their military
oaths to continue in service for a new and unjust
cause of war, ought to ‘desert their employment and
suffer anything that could be done to them before
they draw their swords against their own conscience
and judgments in an unjust quarrel.’<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>These moral sentiments of a military man of the
seventeenth century are absolutely alien to the military
doctrines of the present day; and his remarks
on wages recall yet another important landmark of
ancient thought that has been removed by the progress
of time. Early Greek opinion justly made
no distinction between the mercenary who served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
a foreign country and the mercenary who served his
own. All hired military service was regarded as
disgraceful, nor would anyone of good birth have
dreamt of serving his own country save at his own
expense. The Carians rendered their names infamous
as the first of the Greek race who served for
pay; whilst at Athens Pericles introduced the custom
of supporting the poorer defenders of their country out
of the exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Afterwards, of course, no people
ever committed itself more eagerly to the pursuit
of mercenary warfare.</p>

<p>In England also gratuitous military service was
originally the condition of the feudal tenure of land,
nor was anyone bound to serve the king for more
than a certain number of days in the year, forty being
generally the longest term. For all service in excess
of the legal limit the king was obliged to pay; and
in this way, and by the scutage tax, by which many
tenants bought themselves off from their strict obligations,
the principle of a paid military force was
recognised from the time of the Conquest. But the
chief stipendiary forces appear to have been foreign
mercenaries, supported, not out of the commutation
tax, but out of the king’s privy purse, and still more
out of the loot won from their victims in war. These
were those soldiers of fortune, chiefly from Flanders,
Brabançons, or Routers, whose excesses as brigands
led to their excommunication by the Third Lateran
Council (1179), and to their destruction by a crusade
three years later.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>But the germ of our modern recruiting system must
rather be looked for in those military contracts or indentures,
by which from about the time of Edward III.
it became customary to raise our forces: some powerful
subject contracting with the king, in consideration of a
certain sum, to provide soldiers for a certain time and
task. Thus in 1382 the war-loving Bishop of Norwich
contracted with Richard II. to provide 2,500 men-at-arms
and 2,500 archers for a year’s service in France,
in consideration of the whole fifteenth that had been
voted by Parliament for the war.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> In the same way
several bishops indented to raise soldiers for Henry V.
And thus a foreign war became a mere matter of
business and hire, and armies to fight the French were
raised by speculative contractors, very much as men
are raised nowadays to make railways or take part
in other works needful for the public at large. The
engagement was purely pecuniary and commercial,
and was entirely divested of any connection with
conscience or patriotism. On the other hand, the
most obviously just cause of war, that of national
defence in case of invasion, continued to be altogether
disconnected with pay, and remained so much the
duty of the militia or capable male population of the
country, that both Edward III. and Richard II. directed
writs even to archbishops and bishops to arm and array
all abbots, priors, and monks, between the ages of
sixteen and sixty, for the defence of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Originally, therefore, the paid army of England,
as opposed to the militia, implied the introduction of
a strictly mercenary force consisting indifferently of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
natives or foreigners, into our military system. But
clearly there was no moral difference between the
two classes of mercenaries so engaged. The hire, and
not the cause, being the main consideration of both,
the Englishman and the Brabançon were equally mercenaries
in the ordinary acceptation of the term. The
prejudice against mercenaries either goes too far or
not far enough. If a Swiss or an Italian hiring himself
to fight for a cause about which he was ignorant
or indifferent was a mercenary soldier, so was an
Englishman who with equal ignorance and indifference
accepted the wages offered him by a military
contractor of his own nation. Either the conduct of
the Swiss was blameless, or the Englishman’s moral
delinquency was the same as his.</p>

<p>The public opinion of former times regarded
both, of course, as equally blameless, or rather as
equally meritorious. And it is worth noticing that
the word <i>mercenary</i> was applied alike to the hired
military servant of his own as of another country.
Shakespeare, for instance, applies the term mercenary
to the 1,600 Frenchmen of low degree slain at
Agincourt, whom Monstrelet distinguishes from the
10,000 Frenchmen of position who lost their lives on
that memorable day&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">In this ten thousand they have lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And even so late as 1756, the original signification
of the word had so little changed, that in the
great debate in the House of Lords on the Militia Bill
of that year Lord Temple and several other orators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
spoke of the national standing army as an army of
<i>mercenaries</i>, without making any distinction between
the Englishmen and the Hessians who served in it.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>The moral distinction that now prevails between
the paid service of natives and of foreigners is, therefore,
of comparatively recent origin. It was one of
the features of the Reformation in Switzerland that
its leaders insisted for the first time on a moral difference
between Swiss soldiers who served their own
country for pay, and those who with equal bravery and
credit sold their strength to the service of the highest
foreign bidder.</p>

<p>Zwingli, and after him his disciple Bullinger,
effected a change in the moral sentiment of Switzerland
equivalent to that which a man would effect
nowadays who should persuade men to discountenance
or abandon military service of any kind for pay. One
of the great obstacles to Zwingli’s success was his
decided protest against the right of any Swiss to sell
himself to foreign governments for the commission of
bloodshed, regardless of any injury in justification;
and it was mainly on that account that Bullinger
succeeded in 1549 in preventing a renewal of the
alliance or military contract between the cantons and
Henry II. of France. ‘When a private individual,’
he said, ‘is free to enrol himself or not, and engages
himself to fight against the friends and allies of his
sovereign, I know not whether he does not hire himself
to commit homicide, and whether he does not act
like the gladiators, who, to amuse the Roman people,
let themselves to the first comer to kill one another.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is evident that, except with a reservation
limiting a man’s service to a just national cause,
Bullinger’s argument will also apply to the case of a
hired soldier of his own country. The duty of every
man to defend his country in case of invasion is intelligible
enough; and it is very important to notice
that originally in no country did the duty of military
obedience mean more. In 1297 the High Constable
and Marshal of England refused to muster the forces
to serve Edward I. in Flanders, on the plea that
neither they nor their ancestors were obliged to serve
the king outside his dominions;<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and Sir E. Coke’s
ruling in Calvin’s case,<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> that Englishmen are bound to
attend the king in his wars as well without as within
the realm, and that their allegiance is not local but
indefinite, was not accepted by writers on the constitution
of the country. The existing militia oath, which
strictly limits obedience to the defence of the realm,
covered the whole military duty of our ancestors;
and it was only the innovation of the military contract
that prepared the way for our modern idea of
the soldier’s duty as unqualified and unlimited with
regard to cause and place and time. The very word
<i>soldier</i> meant originally stipendiary, his pay or <i>solde</i>
(from the Latin <i>solidum</i>) coming to constitute his
chief characteristic. From a servant hired for a certain
task for a certain time the steps were easy to a
servant whose hire bound him to any task and for the
whole of his life. The existing military oath, which
binds a recruit and practically compels him as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
to a war of aggression as of defence at the bidding
of the executive, owes its origin to the revolution of
1689, when the refusal of Dumbarton’s famous Scotch
regiment to serve their new master, William III., in
the defence of Holland against France, rendered it
advisable to pass the Mutiny Act, containing a more
stringent definition of military duty by an oath
couched in extremely general terms. Such has been
the effect of time in confirming this newer doctrine of
the contract implied by the military status, that the
defence of the monarch ‘in person, crown, and dignity
against all enemies,’ to which the modern recruit
pledges himself at his attestation, would be held to
bind the soldier not to withhold his services were he
called upon to exercise them in the planet Mars itself.</p>

<p>Hence it appears to be an indisputable fact of
history that the modern military theory of Europe,
which demands complete spiritual self-abandonment
and unqualified obedience on the part of a soldier, is
a distinct trespass outside the bounds of the original
and, so to speak, constitutional idea of military duty;
and that in our own country it is as much an encroachment
on the rights of Englishmen as it is on the wider
rights of man.</p>

<p>But what is the value of the theory itself, even if
we take no account of the history of its growth? If
military service precludes a man from discussing the
justice of the end pursued in a war, it can hardly be
disputed that it equally precludes him from inquiries
about the means, and that if he is bound to consider
himself as fighting in any case for a lawful cause he
has no right to bring his moral sense to bear upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
details of the service required of him. But here occurs
a loophole, a flaw, in the argument; for no subject
nor soldier can be compelled to serve as a spy, however
needful such service may be. That proves that
a limit does exist to the claims on a soldier’s obedience.
And Vattel mentions as a common occurrence the
refusal of troops to act when the cruelty of the deeds
commanded of them exposed them to the danger of
savage reprisals. ‘Officers,’ he says, ‘who had the
highest sense of honour, though ready to shed their
blood in a field of battle for their prince’s service, have
not thought it any part of their duty to run the
hazard of an ignominious death,’ such as was involved
in the execution of such behests. Yet why not, if
their prince or general commanded them? By what
principle of morality or common sense were they
justified in declining a particular service as too
iniquitous for them and yet in holding themselves
bound to the larger iniquity of an aggressive war?
What right has a machine to choose or decide between
good and bad any more than between just and unjust?
Its moral incompetence must be thoroughgoing, or
else in no case afford an extenuating plea. You
must either grant it everything or nothing, or else
offer a rational explanation for your rule of distinction.
For it clearly needs explaining, why, if there
are orders which a soldier is not bound to obey, if
there are cases where he is competent to discuss the
moral nature of the services required of him, it should
not also be open to him to discuss the justice of the
war itself of which those services are merely incidents.</p>

<p>Let us turn from the abstract to the concrete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
and take two instances as a test of the principle.
In 1689, Marshal Duras, commander of the French
army of the Rhine, received orders to destroy the
Palatinate, and make a desert between France and
Germany, though neither the Elector nor his people
had done the least injury to France. Did a single
soldier, did a single officer quail or hesitate? Voltaire
tells us that many officers felt shame in acting as the
instrument of this iniquity of Louis XIV., but they
acted nevertheless in accordance with their supposed
honour, and with the still orthodox theory of military
duty. They stopped short at no atrocity. They cut
down the fruit-trees, they tore down the vines, they
burnt the granaries; they set fire to villages, to
country-houses, to castles; they desecrated the tombs
of the ancient German emperors at Spiers; they plundered
the churches; they reduced well-nigh to ashes
Oppenheim, Spiers, Worms, Mannheim, Heidelberg,
and other flourishing cities; they reduced 400,000
human beings to homelessness and destruction&mdash;and
all in the name of military duty and military honour!
Yet, of a truth, those were dastardly deeds if ever
dastardly deeds have been done beneath the sun; and
it is the sheerest sophistry to maintain that the men
who so implicitly carried out their orders would not
have done more for their miserable honour, would
not have had a higher conception of duty, had they
followed the dictates of their reason and conscience
rather than those of their military superiors, and refused
to sacrifice their humanity to an overstrained
theory of their military obligation, and their memory
to everlasting execration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of these destroyers military duty
meant simply military servility, and it was this reckless
servility that led Voltaire in his ‘Candide’ to
put into the mouth of his inimitable philosopher,
Martin, that definition of an army which tales like
the foregoing suggested and justified: ‘A million of
assassins, in regiments, traversing Europe from end
to end, and committing murder and brigandage by
rules of discipline for the sake of bread, because incompetent
to exercise any more honest calling.’<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>An English case of this century may be taken as
a parallel one to the French of the seventeenth, and as
an additional test of the orthodox military dogma
that with the cause of war a soldier has no concern.
It is the Copenhagen expedition of 1807, than which
no act of might within this century was more strongly
reprobated by the public opinion of Europe, and by
all but the Tory opinion of England. A fleet and
army having been sent to the Danish capital, and
the Danish Government having refused to surrender
their fleet, which was demanded as the alternative of
bombardment, the English military officials proceeded
to bombard the city, with infinite destruction and
slaughter, which were only stayed at last by the surrender
of the fleet as originally demanded. There was
no quarrel with Denmark at the time, there was no
complaint of injury; only the surrender of the fleet was
demanded. English public opinion was both excited
and divided about the morality of this act, which was
only justified on the plea that the Government was
in possession of a secret article of the Treaty of Tilsit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
between Napoleon and the Czar of Russia, by which
the Danish fleet was to be made use of in an attack
upon England. But this secret article was not divulged,
according to Alison, till ten years afterwards,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
and many disbelieved in its existence altogether, even
supposing that its existence would have been a good
case for war. Many military men therefore shared
in the feeling that condemned the act, yet they
scrupled not to contribute their aid to it. Were they
right? Read Sir C. Napier’s opinion of it at the
time, and then say where, in the case of a man so
thinking, would have lain his duty: ‘This Copenhagen
expedition&mdash;is it an unjust action for the general
good? Who can say that such a precedent is pardonable?
When once the line of justice has been
passed, there is no shame left. England has been
unjust.... Was not our high honour worth the
danger we might perhaps have risked in maintaining
that honour inviolate?’<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>These opinions, whether right or wrong, were
shared by many men in both services. Sir C. Napier
himself says: ‘Were there not plenty of soldiers who
thought these things wrong? ... but would it have
been possible to allow the army and navy ... to
decide upon the propriety of such attacks?’<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> The
answer is, that if they did, whether allowed or not,
such things would be impossible, or, at all events, less
probable: which is the best reason possible for the
contention that they should. Had they done so in
this very instance, our historians would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
spared the explanation of an episode that is a dark blot
upon our annals.</p>

<p>A more pleasing precedent, therefore, than that of
the French officers in the Palatinate, or of the English
at Copenhagen, is the case of Admiral Keppel, who,
whilst numbers of naval officers flocked to the Admiralty
to offer their services or to request employment,
steadily declined to take part in the war of England
against her American colonies, because he deemed
her cause a bad one.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> He did no violence to his reason
or conscience nor tarnished his fame by acting a part,
of which in his individual capacity he disapproved.
His example is here held up as illustrating the only
true doctrine, and the only one that at all accords with
the most rudimentary principles of either religion or
morality. The contrary doctrine bids a man to forswear
the use of both his reason and his conscience in
consideration for his pay, and deprives him of that
liberty of thought and moral action compared with
which his civil and political liberty are nothing worth.
For what indeed is this contrary time-honoured doctrine
when stripped of all superfluities, and displayed
in the outfit of common sense and common words?
What is it but that the duty of military obedience
overrides all duty of a man towards himself; that,
though he may not voluntarily destroy his body, he
cannot do too much violence to his soul; that it is his
duty to annihilate his moral and intellectual being, to
commit spiritual suicide, to forego the use of the noblest
faculties which belong to him as a man; that to do all
this is a just cause of pride to him, and that he is in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
respects the nobler and better for assimilating himself
to that brainless and heartless condition which is that
also of his charger or his rifle?</p>

<p>If this doctrine is true and sound, then it may be
asked whether there has ever been or exists upon
the earth any tyranny, ecclesiastical or political, comparable
to this military one; whether any but the baser
forms of priestcraft have ever sought to deprive a man
so completely of the enjoyment of his highest human
attributes, or to absolve him so utterly from all moral
responsibility for his actions.</p>

<p>This position can scarcely be disputed, save by
denying the reality of any distinction between just and
unjust in international conduct; and against this denial
may be set not only the evidence of every age, but of
every language above the stage of mere barbarism.
Disregard of the difference is one of the best measures
of the civilisation of a people or epoch. We at once,
for instance, form a higher estimate of the civilisation
of ancient India, when we read in Arrian that her kings
were so apprehensive of committing an unjust aggression
that they would not lead their armies out of India
for the conquest of other nations.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> One of the best
features in the old pagan world was the importance
attached to the justice of the motives for breaking the
peace. The Romans appear never to have begun a
war without a previous consultation with the College
of Fecials as to its justice; and in the same way, and
for the same purpose, the early Christian emperors
consulted the opinion of the bishops. If a Roman
general made an unjust attack upon a people his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
triumph was refused, or at least resisted; nor are the
instances infrequent in which the senate decreed restitution
where a consul, acting on his own responsibility,
had deprived a population of its arms, its lands,
or its liberties.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Hence the Romans, with all their
apparent aggressiveness, won the character of a strict
regard to justice, which was no small part of the secret
of their power. ‘You boast,’ the Rhodians said to
them, ‘that your wars are successful because they are
just, and plume yourselves not so much on the victory
which concludes them as on the fact that you never
begin them without good cause.’<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Conquest corrupted
the Romans in these respects as it has done many
another people; but even to the end of the Republic
the tradition of justice survived; nor is there anything
finer in the history of that people than the attempt of
the party headed by Ateius the tribune to prevent
Crassus leaving Rome when he was setting out to make
war upon the Parthians, who not only had committed
no injury, but were the allies of the Republic; or than
the vote of Cato, that Cæsar, who, in time of peace,
had slain or routed 300,000 Germans, should be given
up to the people he had injured in atonement for the
wrong he had done to them.</p>

<p>The idea of the importance of a just cause of war
may be traced, of course, in history, after the extinction
of the grand pagan philosophy in which it had its
origin. It was insisted on even by Christian writers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
who, like St. Augustine, did not regard all military
service as wicked. What, he asked, were kingdoms
but robberies on a vast scale, if their justice were put
out of the reckoning.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> A French writer of the time of
Charles V. concluded that while soldiers who fell in a
just cause were saved, those who died for an unjust
cause perished in a state of mortal sin.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Even the
Chevalier Bayard, who accompanied Charles VIII.
without any scruple in his conquest of Naples, was
fond of saying that all empires, kingdoms, and provinces
were, if without the principle of justice, no better
than forests full of brigands;<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and the fine saying is
attributed to him, that the strength of arms should
only be employed for the establishment of right and
equity. But on the whole the justice of the cause of
war became of less and less importance as time went
on; nor have our modern Christian societies ever derived
benefit in that respect from the instruction or
guidance of their churches at all equal to that which
the society of pagan Rome derived from the institution
of its Fecials, as the guardians of the national conscience.</p>

<p>It was among the humane endeavours of Grotius
to try to remedy this defect in modern States by
establishing certain general principles by which it
might be possible to test the pretext of any given
war from the side of its justice. At first sight it
appears obvious that a definite injury is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
justification for a resort to hostilities, or, in other
words, that only a defensive war is just; but then
the question arises how far defence may be anticipatory,
and an injury feared or probable give the
same rights as one actually sustained. The majority
of wars, that have not been merely wars of conquest
and robbery, may be traced to that principle in history,
so well expressed by Livy, that men’s anxiety
not to be afraid of others causes them to become
objects of dread themselves.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> For this reason Grotius
refused to admit as a good <i>casus belli</i> the fact that
another nation was making warlike preparations,
building garrisons and fortresses, or that its power
might, if unchecked, grow to be dangerous. He also
rejected the pretext of mere utility as a good ground
for war, or such pleas as the need of better territory,
the right of first discovery, or the improvement or
punishment of barbarous nations.</p>

<p>A strict adherence to these principles, vague as
they are, would have prevented most of the bloodshed
that has occurred in Europe since Grotius wrote.
The difficulty, however, is, that, as between nations,
the principle of utility easily overshadows that of
justice; and although the two are related as the
temporary to the permanent expediency, and therefore
as the lesser to the greater expediency, the
relation between them is seldom obvious at the time
of choice, and it is easy beforehand to demonstrate
the expediency of a war of which time alone can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
show both the inexpediency and the injustice. Any
war, therefore, however unjust it may seem, when
judged by the canons of Grotius, is easily construed
as just when measured by the light of an imperious
and magnified passing interest; and the absence of
any recognised definition or standard of just dealing
between nations affords a salve to many a conscience
that in the matters of private life would be sensitive
and scrupulous enough. The story of King Agesilaus
is a mirror in which very few ages or countries may
not see their own history reflected. When Phœbidas,
the Spartan general, seized the Cadmeia of Thebes in
the time of peace, the greater part of Greece and
many Spartans condemned it as a most iniquitous
act of war; but Agesilaus, who at other times was
wont to talk of justice as the greatest of all the
virtues, and of valour without it as of little worth,
defended his officer’s action, on the plea that it was
necessary to regard the tendency of the action, and
to account it even as glorious if it resulted in an
advantage to Sparta.</p>

<p>But when every allowance is made for wars of
which the justice is not clearly defined from the
expediency, many wars have occurred of so palpably
unjust a character, that they could not have been
possible but for the existence of the loosest sentiments
with regard to the responsibility of those who
took part in them. We read of wars or the pretexts
of wars in history of which we all, whether military
men or civilians, readily recognise the injustice; and
by applying the same principles of judgment to the
wars of our own country and time we are each and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
all of us furnished for the direction of our conscience
with a standard which, if not absolutely scientific or
consistent, is sufficient for all the practical purposes
of life, and is completely subversive of the excuse
which is afforded by occasional instances of difficult
and doubtful decision. The same facilities which
exist for the civilian when he votes for or against
taxation for a given war, or in approval or disapproval
of the government which undertakes it, exist
also for the soldier who lends his active aid to it;
nor is it unreasonable to claim for the action of the
one the same responsibility to his own conscience
which by general admission attaches to the other.</p>

<p>It is surely something like a degradation to the
soldier that he should not enjoy in this respect the
same rights as the civilian; that his merit alone
should be tested by no higher a theory of duty than
that which is applied to the merit of a horse; and
that his capacity for blind and unreasoning obedience
should be accounted his highest attainable virtue.
The transition from the idea of military vassalage to
that of military allegiance has surely produced a
strange conception of honour, and one fitter for conscripts
than for free men, when a man is held as by a
vice to take part in a course of action which he
believes to be wrong. Not only does no other profession
enforce such an obligation, but in every other
walk of life a man’s assertion of his own personal
responsibility is a source rather of credit to him than
of infamy. That in the performance of any social
function a man should be called upon to make an unconditional
surrender of his free will, and yield an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
obedience as thoughtless as a dummy’s to superior
orders, would seem to be a principle of conduct
pilfered from the Society of Jesus, and utterly unworthy
of the nobility of a soldier. As a matter of
history, the priestly organisation took the military
one for its model: which should lead us to suspect
that the tyranny we find fault with in the copy is
equally present in the original, and that the latter is
marked by the same vices that it transmitted to the
borrowed organisation.</p>

<p>The principle here contended for, that the soldier
should be fully satisfied in his own mind of the justice
of the cause he fights for, is the condition that
Christian writers, from Augustine to Grotius, have
placed on the lawfulness of military service. The
objection to it, that its adoption would mean the ruin
of military discipline, will appear the greatest argument
of all in its favour when we reflect that its
universal adoption would make war itself, which is
the only reason for discipline, altogether impossible.
Where would have been the wars of the last two
hundred years had it been in force? Or where the
English wars of the last six, with their thousands of
lives and their millions of money spent for no visible
good nor glory in fighting with Afghans, Zulus,
Egyptians, and Arabs? Once restrict legitimate
warfare to the limits of national defence, and it is
evident that the refusal of men to take part in a war
of aggression would equally put an end to the necessity
of defensive exertion. If no government could
rely on its subjects for the purposes of aggression and
injustice, it goes without saying that the just cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
war would perish simultaneously. It is therefore
altogether to be wished that that reliance should be
weakened and destroyed.</p>

<p>The reasoning, then, which contains the key that
is alone capable of closing permanently the portals of
Janus is this: that there exists a distinction between
a just and an unjust war, between a good and a bad
cause, and that no man has a right either to take part
knowingly and wilfully in a cause he believes to be
unjust, nor to commit himself servilely to a theory
of duty which deprives him, at the very outset, of
his inalienable human birthright of free thought and
free will. This is the principle of personal responsibility
which has long since won admission everywhere
save in the service of Mars, and which requires
but to be extended there to free the world from the
custom that has longest and most ruinously afflicted
it. For it attacks that custom where it has never yet
been seriously attacked before, at its real source&mdash;namely,
in the heart, the brain, and the conscience,
that, in spite of all warping and training, still belong
to the individual units who alone make it possible.
It behoves all of us, therefore, who are interested in
abolishing military barbarism, not merely to yield a
passive assent to it ourselves, but to claim for it assent
and assertion from others. We must ask and reask
the question: What is the title by which a man,
through the mere fact of his military cloth, claims
exemption from the moral law that is universally
binding upon his fellows?</p>

<p>For this principle of individual military responsi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>bility
is of such power, that if carried to its consequences,
it must ultimately prove fatal to militarism;
and if it has not yet the prescription of time and
common opinion in its favour, it is sealed nevertheless
with the authority of many of the best intellects that
have helped to enlighten the past, and is indissolubly
contained in the teaching alike of our religious as of
our moral code. It can, in fact, only be gainsaid by
a denial of the fundamental maxims of those two
guides of our conduct, and for that reason stands
absolutely proof against the assaults of argument.
Try to reconcile with the ordinary conceptions of the
duties of a man or a Christian the duty of doing what
his conscience condemns, and it may be safely predicted
that you will try in vain. The considerations
that may occur of utility and expediency beat in vain
against the far greater expediency of a world at
peace, freed from the curse of the warrior’s destructiveness;
nor can the whole armoury of military logic
supply a single counter-argument which does not resolve
itself into an argument of supposed expediency,
and which may not therefore be effectually parried,
even on this narrower debating ground, by the consideration
of the overwhelming advantages which
could not but flow from the universal acceptance of the
contrary and higher principle&mdash;the principle that for
a soldier, as for anyone else, his first duty is to his
conscience.</p>

<p>Or, to put the conclusion in the fewest words: The
soldier claims to be a non-moral agent. That is the
corner-stone of the whole military system. Challenge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
then the claimant to justify his first principle, and the
custom of war will shake to its foundation, and in
time go the way that other evil customs have gone
before it, when once their moral support has been
undermined or shattered.</p>

‘En 1793 et en 1794, le gouvernement anglais ayant violé le droit des
gens contre la République Française, la Convention, dans un accès de
brutale colère, décréta qu’il ne serait plus fait aucun prisonnier anglais
ou hanovrien, c’est-à-dire que les vaincus seraient mis à mort, encore
qu’ils se rendissent. Mais ce décret fut simplement comminatoire; le
Comité de Salut Public, sachant très-bien que de misérables soldats
n’étaient point coupables, donna l’ordre secret de faire grâce à tous les
vaincus.’</p></div>
